<div class="entry-content"><p>In this post I will outline a method <a href="http://jwepman.com">Josh Wepman</a> and I have developed for detecting tail calls in programs constructed from a subset of Python. Its original purpose was a Python to x86 compiler we worked on together for a compiler construction course at CU.<sup>1</sup> The approach probably isn&#8217;t new, but it is straightforward and understandable, and might help other novice compiler writers understand a fundamental optimization.</p>

<h2>1. What is a tail call?</h2>

<p>A tail call occurs when a function (the caller) calls another function (the callee) and then immediately returns the callee&#8217;s value. Here is a simple example where <code>f()</code> is the caller, and <code>g()</code> is the callee:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 1.1</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, a function call is in <em>tail call position</em> when its return value is immediately returned. In the above example, it is <code>g()</code> that is in tail call position. Contrast this with the following example, where <code>g()</code> is not in tail call position:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 1.2</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here, <code>g()</code> falls within the return statement of <code>f()</code>, but is not in tail call position because <code>g()</code>&#8217;s return value is used in the multiplication before it is returned by <code>f()</code>.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Also consider the following example where <code>g()</code> is not in tail call position, but could easily be transformed into a program that is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 1.3</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since the only thing that happens to <code>g()</code>&#8217;s value is that it is copied and then returned, the assignments could be removed, and <code>g()</code>&#8217;s value could be immediately returned without modifying the semantics of the program. Also notice that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are local variables, so it&#8217;s guaranteed that their values are not used elsewhere in the program, and so they can be safely removed. The semantically equivalent tail calling program would look like the original example (1.1):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 1.1</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>2. Why bother detecting them?</h2>

<p>Why are tail calls interesting? I want this post to be mainly about the analysis, so I won&#8217;t delve too deeply into the mechanics of the machine code, but essentially tail calls allow for a compiler optimization where the callee can hand its return value straight to the caller of the caller. This will make more sense when you consider this extended version of example 1.1:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 2.1</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">g</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>  
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here, <code>g()</code> will return 1 to <code>f()</code> and <code>f()</code> will return 1 to <code>print</code>, but, since all <code>f()</code> does is immediately return <code>g()</code>&#8217;s value to <code>print</code>, why not skip that step entirely? That is, why not simply have <code>g()</code> give its return value directly to <code>print</code>? That&#8217;s how tail call optimization works. In the optimized version, <code>g()</code> returns its value directly to <code>print</code> rather than forcing <code>f()</code> to be the middleman. This is implemented on the machine code level by having the call to <code>g()</code> reuse <code>f()</code>&#8217;s stack frame. The result is that when <code>g()</code> returns, it hands its value directly to <code>print</code>.<sup>3</sup> The advantage is that since each call doesn&#8217;t result in the allocation of a new stack frame, the compiled code will be slightly faster, and the recursion depth will be practically unlimited (or at least not limited by the size of the call stack).</p>

<p>Notice, though, that the actual optimization occurs at the machine code level, in the instruction selection phase of the compiler, which isn&#8217;t the subject of this post. Instead, the subject is detecting when this optimization can be performed, and, additionally, transforming programs into ones that are eligible for this optimization. More on that in the next section.</p>

<h2>3. Goals of the Analysis</h2>

<p>One of the design goals of the analysis is for it to detect both of the situations outlined in section 1. That is, it should:</p>

<ol>
<li>Detect obvious cases of tail calls, where a function call is directly nested within a <code>return</code> statement and</li>
<li>Detect less obvious cases where a program isn&#8217;t tail calling, but could be transformed into one that is.</li>
</ol>


<p>To elaborate on the second goal, <em>we want to detect instances where a return value is assigned to a variable, copied through a series of assignments, and then immediately returned without any intervening code.</em> This situation occurs in example 1.3, and is the reason it could be transformed into a tail calling program. Here is another example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 3.1</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If <code>input()</code> evaluates to true, then the value of <code>g()</code> gets assigned to <code>x</code>, and is immediately returned. Transforming this into a semantically equivalent tail calling program is as simple as pushing the <code>return</code> statement up into the <code>if</code> branch:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 3.2</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now <code>g()</code> is in tail call position, but the semantics of the program haven&#8217;t changed.</p>

<p>Contrast that with this example that can&#8217;t be optimized (at least not by this analysis):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 3.3</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;About to return&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This example doesn&#8217;t meet the last requirement that the copied return value is &#8220;immediately returned without any intervening code.&#8221; Since our transformation pushes the <code>return</code> statement up to the function call to <code>g()</code>, we get the following program:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 3.4</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;About to return&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now the <code>print</code> statement is never reached. A more nuanced analysis might handle a case like this, but ours won&#8217;t.</p>

<h2>4. Complications: The naive analysis, dispatch code, and flattening.</h2>

<p>Now that we understand the parameters of the analysis&#8211;what we will detect, and what we won&#8217;t&#8211;how do we implement it? The first requirement is to detect obvious cases where function calls are nested within <code>return</code> statements. This seems simple. Just traverse the AST<sup>4</sup> and look for that precise situation: where function calls are nested within <code>return</code> statements. The trouble with this technique, and the reason that I call it the &#8220;naive analysis,&#8221; is that, through the course of compilation, every function call gets turned into a set of nested <code>if</code> statements. Returning to example 1.1:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 1.1</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This might get transformed into something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 4.1</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">tmp0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="n">tmp1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">h</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="n">tmp1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">throw_error</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">tmp0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tmp1</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">tmp0</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Why the additional complexity? Remember that Python is a dynamic language. One consequence of this is that at compile time, the compiler doesn&#8217;t know the type of each variable. Is <code>g</code> an <code>int</code>? A <code>float</code>? A class? In many cases, the program needs this information. In the example above, <code>g()</code> will compile to different code if <code>g</code> is the name of a class, versus if <code>g</code> is the name of a function. Because this can&#8217;t always be detected at compile time, the executable must be able to detect the types of variables, and be ready for every case.<sup>5</sup> Returning to the example, the first <code>if</code> might be testing if <code>g</code> is the name of a class. If it is, instead of calling a function named <code>g</code>, it needs to execute <code>g</code>&#8217;s <code>__init__()</code> method. If <code>g</code> isn&#8217;t a class, then it needs to make sure <code>g</code> is a function. If it isn&#8217;t, then the program needs to throw a runtime error. This is one reason why dynamic languages can be slow.</p>

<p>In any case, what matters to us is how this affects our analysis, but thankfully it doesn&#8217;t. Although our compiler has effectively eliminated instances of &#8220;obvious&#8221; tail calls, the example above is still eligible for transformation into a program that contains tail calls. Since the return values of the function calls are assigned to temporary variables, then returned, the transformation is the same as in the simpler examples: push the <code>return</code> statement up to the function calls:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 4.2</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>

</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">h</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">throw_error</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">tmp0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tmp1</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">tmp0</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>return</code> statements have now been pushed up into the branches of the <code>if</code> statement, and <code>g()</code>, <code>h()</code>, and <code>throw_error()</code> are now in tail call position. Nice. Notice that this transformation leaves behind <em>dead code</em>. The assignment <code>tmp0 = tmp1</code> and <code>return tmp0</code> are considered &#8220;dead&#8221; because they will never be reached. Many compilers have a separate phase that removes the dead code that gets created from optimizations like this, but that&#8217;s beyond the scope of this article.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>Aside from the addition of dispatch code, there&#8217;s another important transformation to the code before it reaches the analysis phase. Happily, this transformation actually make detecting tail calls easier. This transformation is called <em>flattening</em>, which means that deeply nested expressions get broken down into simpler statements. Consider this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 4.3</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That would get flattened into:</p>

<p>Notice that the semantics of the program haven&#8217;t changed, but the nested expression <code>input() + 1 + g()</code> gets broken down, or flattened, into a simple series of assignments.<sup>7</sup> Although this appears to add additional complexity, it actually reduces the number of possible cases our analysis will encounter, and shrinks the depth of the AST. Notice that the examples above have already been flattened.</p>

<p>So now that we have a fuller description of what we&#8217;re up against, what does the not-so-naive analysis look like?</p>

<h2>5. The Not-So-Naive Analysis</h2>

<p>The not-so-naive analysis is a <em>flow sensitive static analysis</em>. The analysis follows the control flow of the program and, at each program point, records information about the contents of the variables based on certain rules. A <em>program point</em> is roughly every place in a program where the state of the program could change. In a flattened program, this roughly corresponds to the point before and after every line or statement of code. In the example below, each program point is numbered. The numbers correspond to the order in which each program point will be visited:</p>

<p>So, there is a program point before and after each assignment, and a program point before and after the entire <code>if</code> statement. The order in which the two branches of the <code>if</code> statement are visited doesn&#8217;t matter, but both branches should be visited before leaving the <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>Stepping through the program in this order is easy. Each line of code is an item in a list. Traverse the list in order. If you get to an <code>if</code> statement, do a postorder traversal. First visit the <code>if</code> branch and then the <code>else</code>. Once the value of these branches is determined, the value after the entire <code>if</code> statement can be determined. In other words, in order to determine the value at program point 6, the values at 3 and 5 must be evaluated first.</p>

<p>What do I mean by &#8220;the value at program point 6?&#8221; As hinted at above, each program point is associated with a set of variables. Roughly, this set corresponds to the set of variables that contain return values. The specifics of how variables get added and removed from the set is the subject of a set of rules. Formally, each rule is a function that takes in the set at a program point (usually the one above the current statement) and the statement itself, and outputs a new set that corresponds to the program point after that statement. So, for example, the value at program point 5 is determined by looking at program point 4 and the statement on line 10 (<code>tmp1 = g()</code>). Because that statement stores a return value to <code>tmp1</code>, <code>tmp1</code> gets added to the set at point 5. This is one of the rules. Below are the rules in full. As a shorthand, the program point before a statement is called R<sub>before</sub> and the point after is called R<sub>after</sub>.</p>

<ol>
<li>If the statement is an assignment between variable <code>v</code> and a function call (<code>v = g()</code>), then <em>R<sub>after</sub> = {v}</em>.</li>
<li>If the statement is an assignment from variable <code>t</code> to variable <code>v</code> (<code>v = t</code>), and <code>t</code> is in R<sub>before</sub>, then <em>R<sub>after</sub> = {v}</em>.</li>
<li>At the start of a program, the beginning of a new code block (e.g. the beginning of a branch in an <code>if</code> statement), or the beginning and end of a new scope <em>R<sub>before</sub> = {}</em>.</li>
<li>If the statement is an <code>if</code> statement, then <em>R<sub>after</sub> = R<sub>after-if</sub> ∪ R<sub>after-else</sub></em>. In other words, it is the union of the R<sub>after</sub>s of each branch.</li>
<li>If the statement is a <code>return</code> statement, and variable <code>v</code> is being returned (<code>return v</code>), and <code>v</code> is in R<sub>before</sub>, then the <code>return</code> statement can be pushed up to wherever <code>v</code>&#8217;s value was originally created. In other words, there&#8217;s some function call above that can be put into tail call position (the function that created the value held by <code>v</code>).</li>
<li>In all other cases, <em>R<sub>after</sub> = {}</em>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Some of these rules are intuitive. Some aren&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll go through them one by one and explain them. Keep in mind the goal of the analysis: we&#8217;re trying to detect when return values are copied through a series of assignments and then returned without any intervening code.</p>

<p>This makes the first rule the most intuitive. If a variable gets assigned a return value, add that variable to the set. This would be the first step in detecting something like example 1.3, reproduced below with the sets at each program point. Notice rule 1 in action on lines 4 and 5:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 1.3/5.2</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The second rule keeps track of return values that get copied between variables, and is the reason the set contains <code>y</code> after the 6<sup>th</sup> line. The value of <code>x</code> gets copied to <code>y</code>, and <code>x</code> happens to be in R<sub>before</sub>, so, by rule 2, <code>y</code> is now in R<sub>after</sub>.</p>

<p>The third rules initializes the analysis, and starts the program with an empty set. This rule should also be applied to new code blocks. The two branches of an <code>if</code> statement should begin with empty sets as shown below in a new example:</p>

<p>Although <code>y</code> is in the set before the <code>if</code> statement, both branches of the <code>if</code> statement begin with an empty set.</p>

<p>Example 5.3 also demonstrates rule four. The set after an <code>if</code> statement contains the union of the two branches, in this case just <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>The fifth rule comes into play on line 15. <code>y</code> is returned, and it also happens to be in R<sub>before</sub>. This means that the function call that gave <code>y</code> its value can be put in tail call position. This is done by pushing the <code>return</code> statement up to the call to <code>f()</code> on line 6:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The program has now been transformed into a tail calling program. The analysis has detected that a return value was assigned to a variable, and then returned without any intervening code. Notice, though, that the call to <code>h()</code> on line 10 wasn&#8217;t optimized. It was almost eligible for transformation, but the intervening <code>print</code> statement on line 12 trigged the last rule, and, correctly, prevented the <code>return</code> statement from being pushed up to the call  to <code>h()</code>. This is the purpose of the last rule&#8211;to prevent intervening code from becoming dead code.</p>

<p>There is one last bit of housekeeping. In order for rule 5 to be executed, it needs to know where a variable&#8217;s value was originally created. Consider, once again, example 1.3:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example 1.3/5.2</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="p">{}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">():</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">{}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">y</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The analysis will detect that <code>y</code> is being returned, and recognize that <code>y</code> is in R<sub>before</sub>. This will trigger rule 5, and the analysis will need to know where <code>y</code>&#8217;s value was originally created. How will it determine this? The algorithm is simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>When <code>g()</code> is first assigned to <code>x</code> and <code>x</code> gets added to R<sub>after</sub>, the analysis will record that <code>x</code> is associated with that line (or AST node).</li>
<li>When <code>x</code> gets copied to <code>y</code>, the analysis looks up whichever node/line <code>x</code> was associated with, and then records that <code>y</code> is associated with that same node/line.</li>
<li>When the analysis gets to the last line, it knows that <code>y</code> is associated with line 4 (<code>x = g()</code>), and knows that it can push the <code>return</code> statement up to that position.</li>
</ol>


<p>We are left with the optimized version:</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>Congratulations if you&#8217;ve gotten this far. We&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground. I&#8217;ve touched on several parts of the compiler, and described, in detail, a program analysis for detecting tail calls. Notice, though, that this analysis only covers a very small subset of Python. The rules assume that all <code>if</code> statements also have an <code>else</code> branch. How could this be fixed? I also haven&#8217;t addressed other control flow structures. Adding a rule for <code>while</code> loops would be an important addition. All of these issues would be good exercises to think about, and will, perhaps be the subjects of followup posts.</p>

<li>At first blush, this doesn&#8217;t look nested, but it is: <code>x = (((input()) + 1) + g())</code>. The infix notation is deceptive, but, as demonstrated by the parenthesized version, there are actually 2 levels of addition that roughly correspond to the structure of the flattened code.</li>

<div class="entry-content"><p>One thing I like about Python is that it lets you do just about anything. Classes can be modified at runtime, lists can contain a mix of types, and functions are first-class. The built in dictionaries are especially powerful. They are fast, and can hash and contain just about any immutable datatype, including functions. This allows for a novel use: fast <code>switch</code> statements. Consider the following bit of C, which adds, subtracts, or multiplies two numbers based on the value of <code>op</code>:</p>

<p>There, the three operations are wrapped in functions, and added as values to the dictionary. The <code>get()</code> method looks for the function associated with the value of <code>op</code> and returns the <code>mult</code> function if the key is not in the dictionary, mimicking the action of the <code>default</code> case.<sup>2</sup> Once one of the functions is retrieved, it&#8217;s immediately called, and the appropriate value gets assigned to <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>The advantage of this method is that it&#8217;s fast. Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, so the lookup happens in constant time.<sup>3</sup> <code>elif</code>s and <code>switch</code>es probably take linear time, but would depend on the implementation.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also worth thinking about how something similar could be built using a class and Python&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#getattr">getattr</a> function.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Alice wants to send Bob an encrypted file over the Internet. Alice&#8217;s first attempt is to encrypt the file using 7-zip and send it as an attachment, but quickly realizes that Bob now has no way of decrypting the file. Alice could email the decryption key, but realizes that this is insecure. Why encrypt the file in the first place if she is going to email the key in plaintext? Another solution is to use public key encryption, but contrary to everything we&#8217;ve ever read about Alice and Bob, neither knows how to use GPG. Alex, a dashing computer-scientist-in-training and intrepid narrator of this post, decides to craft a solution. Here is his proposal.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The goal is to create an online service with the following characteristics. It will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Facilitate file exchanges between users.</li>
<li>Not require any accounts.</li>
<li>Not require downloaded software.</li>
<li>Be zero-knowledge. The web service itself must not have access to the decrypted file.</li>
</ol>


<p>In order to meet requirement (4), the service will need to store only encrypted files. This is easy enough. The service can let Alice encrypt the file in her browser, and then host the file, but then we still have the original problem to deal with. Once Bob retrieves the file, how can he access the decryption key? It seems that we have a chicken-or-the-egg problem. Alice and Bob can&#8217;t communicate securely because they don&#8217;t share a key, and they can&#8217;t share a key because they can&#8217;t communicate securely. If only there were some way for two parties to negotiate an encryption key over an insecure channel. Luckily, computer scientists have anticipated this need and come up with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>.</p>

<h2>The Site</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s a sketch of how the service will look to Alice and Bob. In the next section, I&#8217;ll explain the implementation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Alice initiates a file exchange by going to the website and entering the following information:

<ul>
<li>Bob&#8217;s email and cell.</li>
<li>Her email.</li>
<li>A secret password of her choosing (Alice&#8217;s secret key).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The site sends the following to Bob:

<ul>
<li>An email containing a link.</li>
<li>A text message containing a secret code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bob receives the email and link.

<ul>
<li>He navigates to the link and is prompted for the code he received in the text. He enters it.</li>
<li>He is granted access to a form, and he enters a secret password of his choosing (Bob&#8217;s secret key). This doesn&#8217;t need to be the same as Alice&#8217;s secret key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alice receives an email saying the website is ready for her upload.

<ul>
<li>She clicks the link, enters her secret password, and selects her file. Her file gets encrypted in the browser and uploaded to the website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bob gets an email saying the download is ready with a link to a retrieval webpage.

<ul>
<li>He clicks the link and enters his secret password.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s decrypted in the browser, and saved to his hard drive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Readers familiar with the D-H key exchange may already see what&#8217;s going on here. The real trick is in steps (3) and (4) where Alice and Bob are both able to generate a shared secret key without the web service having access to it. Bob and Alice can then encrypt files using the shared secret, and no one but them will be able to decrypt the files.</p>

<h2>Implementation Magic</h2>

<p>So, how does this work? This is the same story, but with the implementation details inserted:</p>

<ol>
<li>Alice initiates a file transfer with Bob, and enters their contact details. The web page uses Javascript or a Java applet to generate the following encryption details:

<ul>
<li>A shared prime <em>p</em> and a generator number <em>g</em>. This gets sent to the web service for storage.</li>
<li>Alice enters a secret password of her choosing, and it gets hashed into a large 128+ bit integer using something like SHA-2. This is her private key <em>a</em> (but she only needs to memorize the password).</li>
<li>In the browser, Alice&#8217;s public key, <em>A</em>, gets calculated. It equals <em>g<sup>a</sup> mod p</em>. This gets sent to the web service for storage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The web service sends out the email and text.</li>
<li>Bob gets the email and text.

<ul>
<li>He enters the secret code from the text into the web page (this will be explained later), and he&#8217;s granted access to the form.</li>
<li>He enters a secret password of his choosing, which also gets hashed just like Alice&#8217;s. This is his private key, <em>b</em>.</li>
<li>In the browser, Bob&#8217;s public key, <em>B</em>, gets calculated as <em>g<sup>b</sup> mod p</em>. This gets sent to the web service for storage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alice receives an email saying that her file is ready for encryption and upload.

<ul>
<li>Bob&#8217;s public key is retrieved, and Alice enters her secret password. In browser, the shared secret is calculated as <em>B<sup>a</sup> mod p</em>.</li>
<li>The file is encrypted using the shared secret.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bob gets an email saying the file is ready for retrieval.

<ul>
<li>Alice&#8217;s public key is retrieved, and he enters his secret password. The shared secret is calculated from <em>A<sup>b</sup> mod p</em>.</li>
<li>In browser, the file is decrypted using the secret key, and the file is saved to disk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Although I still find the process incredible, there&#8217;s really nothing new about the above procedure. It&#8217;s simply an implementation of the D-H exchange that hides the details from the users. What&#8217;s so neat is that the web service and anyone monitoring their communications only ever sees Bob&#8217;s public key, Alice&#8217;s public key, the generator and the prime. No one knows Bob&#8217;s secret key (including Alice!), and no one knows Alice&#8217;s (including Bob). Without these secret keys, no one, including the web service, can calculate the shared encryption key. The web service is zero-knowledge. Sort of.</p>

<h2>Stuck In The Middle</h2>

<p>The most glaring vulnerability with the D-H exchange is the possibility of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This is well documented. If Eve the eavesdropper can intercept and control Bob&#8217;s or Alice&#8217;s email channel, then Eve can sit in the middle and pretend to be both Bob and Alice. Eve can generate two shared secrets, one with Bob and one with Alice. Alice, who thinks Eve is Bob, sends the file to Eve. Eve decrypts it, reads it, then re-encrypts it using the secret she has with Bob (who thinks Eve is Alice), and sends it to Bob. The file is stolen and neither Alice nor Bob know that it happened. This raises two issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the email channel is insecure, Eve could steal the file.</li>
<li>If the service is evil, then the service can steal the file by doing exactly what Eve did.</li>
</ol>


<p>The first problem is solved by the text message containing the secret text code that Bob receives. In order for Bob to finish the exchange, he needs to enter the secret text code into the web page. Eve can&#8217;t do this unless she&#8217;s hijacked both his email and his phone. So, Eve can&#8217;t be the woman-in-the-middle because she can access Bob&#8217;s web page and pretend to be Bob.</p>

<p>The second one is a tough one. A potential solution is for some in-browser code to generate a hash of the public keys (<em>A</em>, and <em>B</em>). Bob and Alice could then use some out-of-band channel (perhaps over the phone) to compare the hashes. If Eve were in the middle, they&#8217;d both have a copy of Eve&#8217;s key, and the hashes wouldn&#8217;t match. The issue here is that if the site really is evil, it could simply poison the browser code to do something evil, making this whole out-of-band hash thing moot. Really, the problem is that there&#8217;s no such thing as a zero-knowledge web site. There has to be some amount of trust between the users and site. One side note is that the site does have a motivation for being honest. As long as it never sees the secret keys, it can&#8217;t be subpoenaed from anything useful (unless a judge orders it to poison its browser code).</p>

<h2>An Alternative Method</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s an alternative method that might be simpler. It uses public key encryption:</p>

<ol>
<li>Alice initiates a file exchange by entering Bob&#8217;s email.</li>
<li>Bob gets the email, and navigates to a page that generates a key pair.

<ul>
<li>The public half of the key pair gets uploaded to the web service. He downloads the private half.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alice gets an email saying the exchange is ready.

<ul>
<li>She navigates to the site, which automatically retrieves the public key, encrypts the file, and uploads it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bob downloads the file and decrypts it using his private key, in-browser.</li>
</ol>


<p>The advantage is that it might be simpler to implement. It&#8217;s really just a way of creating a one-time key pair, and hiding the details from the user. The disadvantage is that Bob has to hold onto a secret key, rather than a passphrase, and the same MITM vulnerability exists (although it could be fixed in a similar way).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s my first stab at a solution. Although I had a lot of fun dreaming it up, it&#8217;s not without its disadvantages, and open questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>The potential for MITM attacks introduces unwanted complexity (especially if you don&#8217;t trust the site). Could this be made more user friendly? Is there another solution?</li>
<li>The entire process is complex, and would probably scare off the exact people it&#8217;s trying to help. Is there an alternative method that&#8217;s simpler, but still maintains zero-knowledge?</li>
<li>Is it secure?</li>
</ol>


<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your comments on these points, or anything related.</p>

<p>Also, many thanks for <a href="http://twitter.com/Cinesias">Cinesias</a> for inspiring me to think about this, and having a bit of a brainstorming session. #FollowFriday</p>

  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>In the last post, I discussed a problem about finding the bad coin in a set of 8 coins. Here, I&#8217;ll do some mathematical analysis of the different algorithms, and talk about the number of steps it takes to search through n coins using each algorithm.</p>

<h2>The Simplest Algorithm</h2>

<p>The first algorithm was the simplest, and consisted of weighing pairs of coins. We begin analyzing this algorithm by first noticing two things: (1) It could take anywhere between 1 and 4 trials to search through the 8 coins. (2) Each of these scenarios is equally likely. There&#8217;s a 1 in 4 possibility that it will be found on the first trial. Ditto for the second, third, and fourth trial. With these two pieces of information, we can calculate the average number of steps it takes to search through 8 coins. This is done by multiplying each outcome (1, 2, 3, or 4 trials) with its probability (1 in 4) and summing the values. The expected value, or average number of steps for 8 coins, is therefore 2.5.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/bad-coin/avg-trials.png" alt="average trials" /></p>

<p>Another way of thinking about this goes as follows: Half the time you&#8217;ll find the coin on or before 2 trials, and half the time you&#8217;ll find the coin on or after 3 trials. Therefore, the average number of trials is 2.5.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s simple enough, but can this be generalized? Yes. For n coins, the following sum represents the average number of trials:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/bad-coin/avgstepssimple.png" alt="average trials general" /></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re skeptical, try out the sum for 8 coins and verify that it produces the same equation as above. The sum simply multiplies each possible outcome (1, 2, 3, or 4 trials) by one over the total number of possible outcomes (1/4). Note that n must be an even number. If it&#8217;s not, then round up to the nearest even number.
So, what are the takeaway points?</p>

<ol>
<li>The average number of trials for n coins is proportional to n.</li>
<li>The number of trials isn&#8217;t fixed. Half the time it will take less than or equal to n/2 trials, and half the time it will take more.</li>
<li>One out of every n/2 times, it will take only 1 trial.</li>
</ol>


<p>The upshot is that the algorithm isn&#8217;t horrible for a small number of coins, but once n starts to get big, so does the number of steps required. In fact, for 8 coins, this algorithm is slightly better, on average, than the binary search, which always takes exactly 3 steps, but it&#8217;s also slightly worse than the ternary search, which always takes 2 steps. As I&#8217;ll show, this doesn&#8217;t hold when the number of coins gets larger.</p>

<h2>The Binary and Ternary Searches</h2>

<p>Calculating the average number of steps for the binary and ternary search is much easier than for the simple algorithm, because the binary and ternary search always take a fixed number of steps, as shown by the decision tree (this isn&#8217;t true if the tree is unbalanced, or if n isn&#8217;t a power of 2 or 3). We can also see that for a decision tree to search through 8 coins, it must have 8 termination points at the bottom of the tree, called &#8220;leaves.&#8221; The number of steps to complete the search is related to this by 2d≥8 for the binary tree and 3d≥8 for the ternary tree, where d is the number of steps or &#8220;depth&#8221; of the tree (Hein, p. 288). Solving for d we get an expression for the minimum number of steps, where n is the number of coins and b is 2 for a binary tree and 3 for a ternary tree:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/bad-coin/treesteps.png" alt="Minimum steps to find coin" /></p>

<p>The brackets are the ceiling operator, which rounds the number up, because a tree&#8217;s depth must be an integer.</p>

<p>Hein takes this a step further and proves that the ternary decision tree is the optimal decision tree (p. 288). If there are 8 coins, there must be 8 leaves on the tree. The minimum depth for a tree with 8 leaves is 2. The tree in the last post has a depth of 2, and therefore must be an optimal tree (among others).</p>

<p>The takeaway points here are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ternary and binary searches take a fixed number of steps (for a balanced tree where n is a power of 2 or 3)</li>
<li>The number of steps for n coins is proportional to logb(n).</li>
<li>The ternary and binary searches scale much better than the simple algorithm. See the table below:</li>
</ol>


<table>
<tr><td>n</td><td>Simple Algorithm</td><td>Binary</td><td>Ternary</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>2.5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>128</td><td>32.5</td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>1024</td><td>256.5</td><td>10</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,048,576</td><td>262,144.5</td><td>20</td><td>13</td></tr>
</table>


<p>As Jon Bentley points out in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880">Programming Pearls</a> [Amazon.com], because the ternary search scales so much better, there&#8217;s some sufficiently large value of n, at which a pocket calculator running the ternary search will outpace a supercomputer running the simple algorithm.</p>

<time datetime="2011-08-17T13:30:00-06:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 17<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
         &bull; <a rel="bookmark" href="/blog/blog/2011/08/17/a-search-algorithm-puzzle-finding-a-bad-coin/">&infin;</a>
        
      </p>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Today I have a puzzle for you from James Hein&#8217;s textbook, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Structures-Logic-Computability-James/dp/0763772062">Discrete Structures, Logic, and Computability</a>. It&#8217;s a question about finding a &#8220;bad coin&#8221; and goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Suppose we are asked to use a pan balance to find the heavy coin among eight coins with the assumption that they all look alike and the other seven all have the same weight. (p. 287)
So, the problem is that we have 8 coins, and one of them is a bad coin that weighs more than the others. With only a pan balance, what&#8217;s the most efficient way to find the bad coin?</p></blockquote>

<p>The simplest solution is to just weigh the coins in pairs. Grab a pair of coins and put one coin on each side of the balance. If one is heavier, you&#8217;ve found the bad coin and you can stop. If they weigh the same, move on to the next pair. At most, this will take 4 trials, but is this optimal? No. As James Hein points out, we can do better.</p>

<p>The better solution is to put 4 of the coins on one side of the balance, and the other 4 coins on the other side of the balance. One side must be heavier than the other, because one side must contain the heavier coin. If the left side is heavier, then we discard the lighter coins on the right side. We then split the remaining coins into 2 groups of 2, and repeat the procedure by weighing one group against the other. The heavier of the two pairs then gets split and weighed. The coin that is heavier is the bad coin. This is a sure way to find the bad coin in 3 steps.</p>

<p>Programmers will recognize this algorithm as a binary search, which can be represented by the following decision tree from page 287 of Hein&#8217;s book:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/bad-coin/dectree.png" alt="Binary Search Tree" /></p>

<p>First we weigh 1 through 4 against 5 through 8. If 1 through 4 is heavier, then we weigh 1 and 2 against 3 and 4 and so on until we reach the bottom of the tree. It&#8217;s a neat solution that has lots of uses. The obvious application for this is searching through lots of data, but an especially cool use is the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding algorithm</a>. A variation on Huffman coding is how zip archives are compressed.</p>

<p>But wait a minute. We can do one better by allowing some decision points (nodes) on the tree to have three connections rather than two, making it a ternary tree. See the revised, and optimal, decision tree below (Hein, p. 288):</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/bad-coin/ternary.png" alt="Optimal Decision Tree" /></p>

<p>For this revised procedure, we begin by weighing 1 through 3 and 4 through 6. If those groups have equal weight, then we go down the middle branch and see that the bad coin must be 7 or 8. We follow a similar procedure if, after the first weighing, 1 through 3 is heavier. We go down the left branch and test 1 and 2. If those weigh the same, then the bad coin must be coin 3. Pretty clever.</p>

<p>Next post I&#8217;ll attempt some mathematical analysis on the algorithms, and see what we can say about how many steps it takes to sort through n coins. In the meantime, check out this <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm#Computer_use">interesting tidbit from Wikipedia&#8217;s Binary Search article</a>. Despite its ubiquity and seeming simplicity, it&#8217;s apparently quite difficult to implement!</p>

  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been playing around with a neat command line utility called netcat. It makes it incredibly easy to add networking functionality to your scripts. What it does is allow you to open a port on your machine and listen for incoming connections. Should a connection occur, anything the remote machine sends is dumped to stdout, and anything written to stdin is sent out to the remote machine. As a demo, I decided to write a database engine with it, and I managed to do it in 16 lines.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

PORT=1234
DATA_FILE="/full/path/to/data"

listen () {
    TIMEOUT=10
    echo "$2" | nc -l -p $1 -w $TIMEOUT -q 0 
}

while :; do
    ANSWER_PORT=$((RANDOM % 1000 + 1028))
    QUERY="$(echo $ANSWER_PORT | nc -l -p $PORT -q 2)"
    ANSWER="$(grep "^$QUERY," "$DATA_FILE" | sed "s/ $QUERY, //")"
    listen "$ANSWER_PORT" "$ANSWER" &amp;
done
</code></pre>

<p>The database itself is simply a text file full of key-value pairs. So, a remote machine can send over a key, and the database responds with that key&#8217;s corresponding value. If, for example, the database was full of names (keys) and phone numbers (values), a remote machine could send over someone&#8217;s name, and the database would respond with that person&#8217;s phone number. Not bad for 16 lines.</p>

<p>Before I step through the code, I&#8217;ll explain its overall functionality. When first executed, the script opens up port 1234 and listens. When a remote machine wants to query it, the remote machine connects to port 1234 and sends over its query (a key). The script receives this and, over the same connection, sends back a random number between 1028 and 2028. Suppose the random number is 1050. The database will then open up port 1050, and when the remote machine connect to that port, the database will send its answer over that connection (the value corresponding to the key), and the transaction is finished. Let&#8217;s look at the code now.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>The script starts off with two variables. The first is the port that the script listens on for incoming queries. The second points to the text file containing the key-value pairs. The file would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>alex beal, 555-555-5555
bob, 111-111-1111
joe, 222-222-2222
</code></pre>

<p>Where, &#8220;alex beal&#8221;, &#8220;bob&#8221;, and &#8220;joe&#8221; are the keys, and the values corresponding to those keys are listed after the comma. Let&#8217;s skip over the listen function for now and examine the while loop below it.</p>

<pre><code>while :; do
    ANSWER_PORT=$((RANDOM % 1000 + 1028))
    QUERY="$(echo $ANSWER_PORT | nc -l -p $PORT -q 2)"
    ANSWER="$(grep "^$QUERY," "$DATA_FILE" | sed "s/^$QUERY, //")" 
    listen "$ANSWER_PORT" "$ANSWER" &amp;
done
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is a while loop that continues forever until the script receives an interrupt. The second two lines get a random number between 1028 and 2028 and store it to <code>$ANSWER_PORT</code>. That value is piped into the netcat instance on the third line, which listens for connections (<code>-l</code>) on port 1234 (<code>-p $PORT</code>). Once a connection is established, and the random port number is sent, the remote host has 2 seconds to send over a query (<code>-q 2</code>), which gets stored to <code>$QUERY</code>. This means that after the first two lines have executed, the query is received, and the random answer port is sent.</p>

<p>The next lines search through the database file for the key-value pair. Searching the database is as simple as <code>grep</code>-ing the data file for the line beginning with the key, and stripping that key from the output with sed.</p>

<p>Finally we call the <code>listen</code> function defined above. This is passed the port that the client must connect to to receive the answer (<code>$ANSWER_PORT</code>), and the answer itself (<code>$ANSWER</code>).</p>

<pre><code>listen () {
    TIMEOUT=10
    echo "$2" | nc -l -p $1 -w $TIMEOUT -q 0 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The answer, which is the second argument (<code>$2</code>), is piped into netcat (<code>nc</code>). The flags tell it to listen (<code>-l</code>) on the port passed to it as the first argument (<code>-p $1</code>). The netcat instance will stop listening after <code>$TIMEOUT</code> seconds, and after the answer is sent, it will close immediately (<code>-q 0</code>). As you can see, the listen function is called as a background process, so the loop can continue back to the top, allowing other requests to be handled while the answer is sent to the client in the background.</p>

<h2>The Client&#8217;s Script</h2>

<p>You can query it remotely with this script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
ANSWERPORT=$(echo "$2" | nc $1 1234)
sleep 1s
nc $1 $ANSWERPORT
</code></pre>

<p>The first line both receives the answer port, and sends over the query. The script then sleeps for 1 second, while the database handles the request. Finally, it connects a second time to retrieve its answer. The script is used as follows:</p>

<pre><code>query.sh REMOTE_IP QUERY_STRING
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although this was a fun exercise, the script itself isn&#8217;t very practical. It&#8217;s slow (at least compared to MySQL), and probably insecure, but there might be a use for it on a private network with trusted users. The take away points here are the different netcat constructs that you could apply to your own programs, such as sending and receiving at the same time, and setting up a client-server model. Definitely let me know in the comments if you end up making something cool!</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>When putting together a backup solution for this web server, I was looking for a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The less new software, the better. Rsync is both powerful and complex, and I wanted to avoid it. Other things being equal, simple solutions are also more reliable.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> I needed to prevent an attacker who gained access to my web server from also gaining access to my backup server. Backing up over an encrypted connection was also a necessity.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning:</strong> I needed my solution to keep several versions of all my files. A solution that only keeps the most recent version of a file is useless, if that version turns out to be corrupted.</li>
<li><strong>Incrementing:</strong> An efficient backup solution should only update the files that have changed. This ruled out simply tar-ing and ssh-ing my entire webroot over to my backup server.</li>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> This solution should automatically run as a cron job.</li>
</ol>


<p>As you can see, some of these goals conflict. Wanting versioned incremental backups, while also ruling out rsync just made my life harder. Automation and security also butt heads. If my web server can access my backup server without a password, how can I prevent an attacker who&#8217;s taken over my web server from trashing my backups? As I&#8217;ll show, I managed to piece this together with only one new software package: rdiff-backup. This took care of versioning and incrementing in a simpler way than rsync would have. The rest was achieved with tools installed on every web server: ssh and cron.</p>

<h2>Backing up with rdiff-backup</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with rdiff-backup. This is dead simple. On Ubuntu, installing is only an apt-get away. This needs to be done on the web server and backup server:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install rdiff-backup
</code></pre>

<p>Backing up to a remote directory over ssh isn&#8217;t much harder:</p>

<pre><code>rdiff-backup /var/www backups@example.com::/var/backups
</code></pre>

<p>That will backup the local directory <code>/var/www</code> to <code>/var/backups</code> on <code>example.com</code> using the ssh user <code>backups</code>. It&#8217;s that simple. rdiff-backup handles the versioning and incrementing automatically. Also, since it&#8217;s done over ssh, everything is encrypted.
Restoring is just as easy:</p>

<pre><code>rdiff-backup -r 3D backups@example.com::/var/backups/www /var/www.old
</code></pre>

<p>That will copy whatever you backed up to <code>/var/backups/www</code> three days prior to <code>/var/www.old</code> on the local machine. Hopefully by now you see why I love this utility. It&#8217;s basically rsync, but stripped down and rebuilt specifically for backups. Best of all, there are no config files or servers to maintain.</p>

<h2>Automation with cron</h2>

<p>So, those are the basics of rdiff-backup. How do we automate this? Here&#8217;s the backup script that I use on this web server:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

RDIFF="/usr/bin/rdiff-backup"
REMOTE="backups@example.com::/home/backups/newest/"
CONF="/etc/backups"

cat $CONF | while read DIR; do
        $RDIFF $DIR $REMOTE$(basename $DIR)
        if [ $? != 0 ]; then
                echo "Exited with errors. Backup process stopped at $DIR"
                exit 1;
        fi
done
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is read the paths I&#8217;ve listed in the text file <code>/etc/backups</code>, and backs those up to <code>/home/backups/newest</code> on the machine <code>example.com</code> with the user <code>backups</code>. So if <code>/etc/backups</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/
/home/alex/
/var/www/
</code></pre>

<p>Then all those directories get backed up to the remote machine. The first time it&#8217;s run, it simply mirrors the directories to the remote machine. Each consecutive execution only copies the changed files over. Versioning is, of course, handled automatically by rdiff-backup.</p>

<p>I wrote the script to be easily customizable. Change <code>$REMOTE</code> to modify which machine, user, and directory the files are backed up to. Change <code>$CONF</code> to modify which file contains all the paths to be backed up. <code>$RDIFF</code> simply points to wherever the rdiff-backup binary is (well, python script, actually). As it&#8217;s currently set, <code>$RDIFF</code> should work on Ubuntu 10.04 machines.</p>

<p>To automate this, simply set it as a cron job on the web server, and run it hourly or daily. Make sure the user running the job has high enough privileges to access the files you want to back up (unless you want to set up some complex permissions, simply running this as root is an unfortunate necessity).</p>

<p>Finally, on the remote machine, you may want some sort of script that manages the backup directory. One idea would be to have the backup directory tar-ed and compressed, then saved somewhere safe. Once that&#8217;s done, the directory could be cleared out, so the next time the backup script runs, a fresh copy of all the files would be copied over. Set this to run once a week and you&#8217;ll have weekly full backups, with nightly (or hourly) incremental backups. The following script will do that for you:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

NEW="/home/backups/newest"
OLD="/home/backups/archive"

# Tar and compress the old files
(
    cd `dirname $NEW`
    tar -zcf "$OLD/`date "+%F-%H%M"`.tar.gz" "`basename "$NEW"`"
)

# Clear out the backup directory
if [ $? == 0 ]; then
    rm -rf "$NEW"
    mkdir "$NEW"
else
    echo "Exited with errors. Nothing was deleted, but the files may not have been rotated."
    exit 1
fi
</code></pre>

<p><code>$NEW</code> is the location of your newest backups. <code>$OLD</code> is where you want the tar-ed and compressed copies stored.</p>

<h2>Security with ssh</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re almost there. Rdiff-backup is installed, and the scripts are automatically backing up and rotating our backup files. The only problem is that every time the script connects to the backup server, it&#8217;s asked for a password (the remote user&#8217;s ssh password). We can&#8217;t be there to type it in, so how do we deal with this? The solution is to create a public/private key pair that the script can log in with. There are lots of places on the web that have detailed instructions on how to do this, but I&#8217;ll run through it quickly.</p>

<p>First we decide which user is running the backup script on our web server. If it&#8217;s root, then we log in as root and run <code>ssh-keygen</code>. When prompted for a password, leave it blank. After this is done, we need to copy the public key located under <code>/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to the remote machine. If we&#8217;re logging in as backups on the remote machine, then we copy the public key into the <code>/home/backups/.ssh</code> directory (create the <code>.ssh</code> directory if it doesn&#8217;t already exist) and rename the file <code>authorized_keys</code>. Now when root connects over ssh to the backup server, he won&#8217;t be prompted for a password, and neither will the backup script being run as a root cron job. Ahhh the magic of public key cryptography.</p>

<p>The obvious problem here is that if an attacker gets root on the web server, he has access to the backup server. Lucky for us, ssh has a built in way of restricting a remote user to only one command. We do this by prefixing the public key with <code>command="RESTRICTED_COMMAND"</code>. So, for example, we can restrict a remote user to rdiff-backup by modifying the <code>authorized_keys</code> file to look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>command="rdiff-backup --server --restrict-update-only /home/backups/newest/" ssh-rsa AAB3NzaC1 [...]
</code></pre>

<p>That allows a remote user to only execute rdiff-backup in server mode. But notice the second flag <code>--restrict-update-only</code>. That restricts the user to the backup directory, and only allows her to update the backups, and not delete or otherwise trash them. Pretty cool. The worst an attacker could do is fill the backup server&#8217;s hard drive by pushing a huge amount of data to it, but since rdiff-backup is versioned, no old versions of the files will be lost.</p>

<p>Also, there are additional options you can prefix to the public key to lock down the server even more. Check out the <code>ssh-keygen</code> man pages, and look under the <code>-O</code> flag.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, that&#8217;s my custom built backup solution. I realize I glazed over a lot of small details, and this isn&#8217;t really a step by step how-to (e.g., I never explained how to set up a cron job). I leave it as an exercise to the reader to put it all together. To help you, I&#8217;ve included the scripts at the bottom of this post. I also check the comments obsessively, so please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions.</p>

<time datetime="2011-08-11T15:49:00-06:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 11<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
         &bull; <a rel="bookmark" href="/blog/blog/2011/08/11/the-surface-area-of-a-sphere-between-parallel-planes/">&infin;</a>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a math problem that surprised me: Imagine a sphere of diameter <em>d</em> intersected by two parallel planes a distance <em>h</em> apart. What do you think the surface area of the section of the sphere between the planes is? You&#8217;re first thought might be that there&#8217;s not enough information. The area will depend upon what part of the sphere the planes intersect. If the planes cut out the middle third of the sphere, that will be a different surface area compared to if the planes cut out the left third or the right third.</p>

<p>That was my first thought, at least, and, as it turns out, it&#8217;s wrong. <strong>The area only depends on the distance between the planes, and the diameter of the sphere. It doesn&#8217;t matter where these planes are in relation to the sphere.</strong> As long as they both intersect the sphere, the surface area will equal <em>πdh</em>, where d is the diameter and <em>h</em> is the distance between the planes. Don&#8217;t believe me? Here&#8217;s the math to prove it:</p>

<p>First we begin with the formula for the surface area of a function rotated around the x axis from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em>. If you want an explanation of this equation, the section of my textbook that covers this is actually <a href="http://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/ESSENTIAL%20CALCULUS/upfiles/topics/ess_at_06_asr_stu.pdf">posted online [PDF]</a> by the publishers (also note that this is problem 32 from that chapter).</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/1.png" alt="Suface Area Formula" /></p>

<p>Since we are finding the surface area of a sphere, we need the function for a circle, which we will rotate around the x axis, thus producing our sphere. If we can remember back to high school geometry, we&#8217;ll know that the equation for a sphere is <em>x2+y2=r2</em>. We now solve for <em>y</em>, and plug it in for <em>f(x)</em>, and also find the derivative of <em>f(x)</em> and plug it in for <em>f&#8217;(x)</em>:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/2.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We now simplify the integral:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/3.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><em>f(x)</em> is moved into the square root:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/4.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We distribute:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/5.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>More simplification:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/6.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/7.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We now integrate:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/8.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/9.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/10.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><em>b-a</em> is simply the distance between the two planes, which we call <em>h</em>:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/11.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>2r is the diameter of the sphere, which we call d:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/12.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>There you have it. The surface area of a sphere between two parallel planes is equal to <em>πdh</em>. It doesn&#8217;t matter where these planes are in relation to the sphere. All that matters is that both planes intersect the sphere. Cool, huh? No? Ok, fine. Well, I thought it was interesting.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a quickie for your Saturday afternoon:</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(s, t)    /* copy t to s; pointer version 3 */
char *s, *t;
{
    while(*s++ = *t++)
        ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s a classic one from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_c_programming_language">K&amp;R text</a> (page 101). You can tell how old it is by the style of the function declaration. There&#8217;s no return type (so it defaults to <code>int</code>, even though nothing is actually returned), and the types of the arguments are declared on a separate line. Although it&#8217;s far from obvious, what the function does is copy the string <code>t</code> to the string <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>Anyway, as you can see, order of operations is key. Dereferencing precedes assignment, assignment precedes evaluation, and evaluation precedes increment. Here&#8217;s what happens:</p>

<ol>
<li>The current position of <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> are dereferenced, and the character at that position is fetched.</li>
<li>That character is copied from <code>t</code> to <code>s</code></li>
<li>The character just copied gets evaluated. The loop terminates if it&#8217;s the null character, &#8216;\0&#8217;.</li>
<li>The pointers are incremented to the next character in the string.</li>
<li>The loop repeats, copying the consecutive characters, including the null character.</li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s definitely a cool academic exercise, but it&#8217;s so obfuscated, that even the order of operations table in the K&amp;R book is of no help. It lists <code>++</code> and <code>*</code> as having the same precedence. To see what&#8217;s going on here, we need to go to the C99 spec:</p>

<blockquote><p>The result of the postfix <code>++</code> operator is the value of the operand. After the result is obtained, the value of the operand is incremented. (page 75)</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s definitely a bit of black magic. Use this code wisely.</p>

         &bull; <a rel="bookmark" href="/blog/blog/2011/08/05/1-minus-1-equals-what-fun-with-sums-and-limits/">&infin;</a>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>

<div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a cool problem I came across when reviewing for one of my calculus exams:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/question.png" alt="The Question" /></p>

<p>You begin with the numbers 0 through 1. Every iteration removes 1/3 from the remaining segments. As stated above, the expression for the total amount removed after m iterations is:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/sum.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>The first iteration removes 1/3. The second removes 1/3 from the remaining two segments. The remaining segments are 1/3 long, and 1/3 of that is 1/9. We do that once for each remaining segment, so 2/9 is removed. And so on.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/sum2.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>What if we iterate an infinite number of times? Then we have a convergent geometric series. Finding the sum is easy:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/sol.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s the total amount or length of numbers removed? 1. That&#8217;s the entire length. It seems like we&#8217;ve removed the entire segment. But wait a minute. If we look at the image of the original question above, we see that after every iteration, there are 2<sup>n+1</sup> segments remaining. When n=0, there are 2 segments. When n=1, there are 4 segments, etc. As we remove more and more, 2<sup>n+1</sup> approaches infinity. In other words, the limit does not exist, and the number of segments goes to infinity.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/limit-dne.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><strong>So, even though we&#8217;ve seemingly removed the entire length, there are an infinite number of segments remaining.</strong> That&#8217;s weird.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now I have you a bit puzzled. This is the point in the post where I&#8217;m supposed to resolve the paradox. I have bad news, though: I don&#8217;t have much for you. I&#8217;m definitely not a mathematician (I just play one on the internets), but if I had to speculate, I&#8217;d say there are two things going on here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Limits!</li>
<li>We&#8217;re taking the math too literally.</li>
</ol>


<p>What I mean by that is, (1) as we&#8217;ve learned from limits, an infinite number of really small things (in this case, segments) can add to a finite number. This doesn&#8217;t quite resolve the paradox though. Usually an infinite number of small things adds to something greater than 0. Here it looks like all the segments add to nothing. There are an infinite number of segments, but we still have nothing left. Hopefully this is where point (2) saves the day.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re taking the math too literally. When we take this sum to infinity, what we&#8217;re really saying is that as we get closer and closer to infinity, we&#8217;re getting closer and closer to removing a length of 1, <em>but we never actually get there.</em> Similarly, when we take the limit, what we&#8217;re really saying is that as we remove more and more segments, we get closer and closer to having an infinite number of segments left over, <em>but we never actually get there either.</em> <strong>As long as we never actually get to either of these points, we haven&#8217;t contradicted ourselves.</strong> I think. If you have a deeper insight into this, definitely be sure to post it in the comments!</p>
