<li>In some languages, prepending to a list is faster than appending. In Python it doesn't matter.</li>
<li>The weird characters in the Vim session are whitespace characters. <code>$</code> is a newline character.</li>

<updated>2012-04-07T17:08:00-06:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.usrsb.in/blog/2012/04/07/look-ma-no-loops</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's a classic interview question:</p>

<blockquote><p>Write a function that takes a string and reverses its word order. So, "Reverse this string" results in "string this Reverse".</p></blockquote>

<p>Notice that the task isn't to reverse the string, but rather to reverse the order of the string's words. So the first word becomes the last. The second word becomes the second to last, and so on.</p>

<p>Whenever I come across puzzles like this, I shudder when I start to think about the nested loops and pointer arithmetic. Unfortunately, that describes the classic solution pretty well. The common wisdom is that first you should reverse the entire string. Then you should go back and reverse each word. So:</p>

<ol>
<li>"Reverse this"</li>
<li>"siht esreveR"</li>
<li>"this Reverse"</li>
</ol>


<p>The first step isn't bad, but reversing each word will require at least one nested loop, and some careful thinking about how to deal with the spaces. Instead, let's think through a functional solution that doesn't involve any loops. It will necessarily be recursive, so the first step will be to come up with each of the cases we'll encouter as we walk the string.</p>

<ul>
<li>Recursive Case 1: We're in the midst of a word. Add the current letter to the end of some word accumulator.</li>
<li>Recursive Case 2: We're at the end of a word (a space). Add the current word accumulator to the beginning of some string accumulator, then clear the word accumulator.</li>
<li>Base Case: The string is empty. Return the word accumulator prepended to the string accumulator.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, there are two accumulators. One grabs the letters of each word as we walk the string and keeps the letters <em>in order</em> (the word accumulator). Then, once an entire word has been read into the word accumulator, it's prepended to the string accumulator. Prepending, reverses the word order. Once it's prepended, the word accumulator is cleared in preparation for the next word. Let's translate this case by case.</p>

<p>The base case is the easiest. Let's start there:</p>

<p>```python Base Case
if len(s) == 0:</p>

<pre><code>return word_acc + str_acc
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Start by testing if the input string, <code>s</code>, is empty. If it is, then we've reached the end of the string, so we return the contents of the <code>word_acc</code>, prepended to the <code>str_acc</code>. <code>word_acc</code> contains the last word in the string, and we're prepending it to the rest of the string that has already been reversed.</p>

<p>Now let's deal with the second recursive case:</p>

<p>```python 2nd Recursive Case
elif s[0] == " ":</p>

<pre><code>return helper(s[1:], "", " " + word_acc + str_acc)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>If we've gotten this far, the input string must have some length, so we check if the first character is a space. If it is, we've reached the end of a word, so we need to prepend <code>str_acc</code> with the word that's just been read in (<code>word_acc</code>). We then clear out the <code>word_acc</code> in preparation for the next word, and recursively call the function with the rest of the input string, <code>s</code>. The recursive call is to <code>helper</code> because this will be nested inside a convenience wrapper that only takes one argument.</p>

<p>Finally, the last case:</p>

<p>```python 1st Recursive Case
else:</p>

<pre><code>return helper(s[1:], word_acc + s[0], str_acc)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>If we've gotten this far, we're in the midst of a word (the string isn't empty, and the current character isn't a space). In this case, we add the current character onto the <code>word_acc</code> and then recurse with the rest of the string. Remember, the <code>word_acc</code> is building up each word character by character as we walk the input string.</p>

<p>Finally, we can simply throw these cases into a function, and it should just work. Ahh, the magic of recursion.</p>

<p>```python Reversing Word Order
def rev_words(s):</p>

<pre><code>'''Returns the string `s` with its words in the reverse order.
   Example: rev_words("Reverse this!") #"this! Reverse"
'''
def helper(s, word_acc, str_acc):
    # Base case: Return word accumulator plus whatever words
    # you have in the string acc
    if len(s) == 0:
        return word_acc + str_acc
    # This is the end of a word. Clear `word_acc`, and start with
    # the next word.
    elif s[0] == " ":
        return helper(s[1:], "", " " + word_acc + str_acc)
    # In the middle of a word. Add the letter to `word_acc`, and continue
    else:
        return helper(s[1:], word_acc + s[0], str_acc)
return helper(s, "", "")
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>As much as I like this solution, it's not without its drawbacks. The most significant is that Python's string methods are very slow. Each concatenation causes both strings to be copied, and at least one concat is happening for each character in the string. Possible solutions include turning the string into a list of characters (list methods are much faster), or using a language that better supports the functional paradigm.<sup>1</sup> But really, if speed is your highest priority, the imperative solution of swapping characters in place is your best bet, warts and all.</p>

<p>If you'd like to play with this code yourself, I've posted <a href="https://gist.github.com/2331327">a gist here</a>, along with some tests.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li>If Python had a constant time prepend function ('cons' in the functional world), I suspect a better solution would be possible.</li>
</ol>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Building Data Structures from Functions]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.usrsb.in/blog/2012/04/01/building-data-structures-from-functions/"/>
<updated>2012-04-01T09:00:00-06:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.usrsb.in/blog/2012/04/01/building-data-structures-from-functions</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's a puzzle I've adapted from <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-14.html#%_sec_2.1.3">exercise 2.4</a> of SICP.</p>

<blockquote><p>Suppose you are programming in a language that only supports function application. That is, defining functions and applying arguments to these functions are the only things this language supports. Using only these building blocks, could you construct a linked list?</p></blockquote>

<p>Surprisingly, the answer is yes, and the exercise linked to above provides a partial solution. Below, I've translated that solution into Python, and completed the exercise:</p>

<p>```python Solution in Python</p>

<h1>Create a pair from l and r</h1>

<p>def cons(l, r):</p>

<pre><code>return lambda get: get(l, r)
</code></pre>

<h1>Given a pair, return the head (left) value.</h1>

<p>def head(pair):</p>

<pre><code>return pair(lambda l, r: l)
</code></pre>

<h1>Give a pair, return the tail (right) value.</h1>

<p>def tail(pair):</p>

<pre><code>return pair(lambda l, r: r)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>First, let's examine how these functions can be used, and then I'll explain how they work. Consider the snippet below:</p>

<p><code>python Usage Example
l1 = cons(1, 2)
print head(l1)       # Prints 1
print tail(l1)       # Prints 2
l2 = cons(0, l1)
print head(l2)       # Prints 0
print head(tail(l2)) # Prints 1
print tail(tail(l2)) # Prints 2
</code></p>

<p>As can be seen, <code>cons()</code> is the constructor for this pair type. Give it two values, and it will create a pair of those two values. <code>head()</code> and <code>tail()</code> are the basic operators that let us access values inside these pairs; they return the left and right element of the pair, respectively. Also notice that we can create pairs of pairs. The last half of the example creates a pair composed of <code>0</code> and <code>(1,2)</code>. Why is this significant? Well, we've just made a linked list! Linked lists are simply pairs of pairs. The list <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> can, for example, be represented as <code>cons(1,cons(2,cons(3,cons(4,None))))</code>. What's <code>None</code> doing at the end of the list? You can think of it like the <code>NULL</code> pointer at the end of a linked list in C. If a function were traversing the list, <code>None</code> would signify to the function that it has reached the end. Mathematically, you can think of a linked list as an inductively defined data structure, where <code>None</code> is the base case. <code>None</code> is referred to as the <em>empty list</em>.</p>

<p>Now for the interesting part. How do these functions work? First let's look at the <code>cons()</code> function:</p>

<p>```python cons()</p>

<h1>Create a pair from l and r</h1>

<p>def cons(l, r):</p>

<pre><code>return lambda get: get(l, r)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This takes in two parameters (<code>l</code> and <code>r</code>) and returns a function.<sup>1</sup> This returned function takes yet another function, which it applies to <code>l</code> and <code>r</code> and returns the result. So, if we call <code>cons(1,2)</code>, we are returned a function, which takes a function and applies that function to the arguments <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>. If, for example, I called <code>cons(1,2)(lambda x, y: x+y)</code> I'd get <code>3</code>, because the addition function would be applied to <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>Now suppose that we didn't want to add <code>l</code> and <code>r</code>. Instead, we wanted to pull either <code>l</code> or <code>r</code> out of a pair that was already constructed. In other words, given <code>list = cons(1,2)</code>, how could we pull the <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> out of the function stored in <code>list</code>? Well, all we need to do is pass it a function that returns only the left or right parameter. So, <code>cons(1,2)(lambda l, r: l)</code> would give us back <code>1</code>, and <code>cons(1,2)(lambda l,r: r)</code> would give us back <code>2</code>. This is almost exactly what the <code>head()</code> and <code>tail()</code> functions are doing! They take in a function (presumably produced by the <code>cons()</code> function), and apply either <code>lambda l,r: l</code> or <code>lambda l,r: r</code>. Just to cement this all together, below I step through the evaluation for the example <code>head(cons(1,2))</code>.</p>

<p><code>python Evaluation Steps for head(cons(1,2,))
head(cons(1,2))
-&gt; head(lambda get: get(1, 2))
-&gt; (lambda get: get(1, 2))(lambda l,r: l)
-&gt; (lambda l,r: l)(1,2)
-&gt; 1
</code></p>

<p>And here is a bit of code that uses these new functions to add the elements of a list:</p>

<p>```python Sum Function
def sum_list(l):</p>

<pre><code>return head(l) if tail(l) == None else head(l) + sum_list(tail(l))
</code></pre>

<p>sum_list(cons(1,cons(2,cons(3,None)))) # Returns 6
```</p>

<p>In the end, this might strike you as nothing more than a useless programming trick. In a sense that's right. I'd never use this in my own code. What makes this technique so valuable is that it actually fits into the broader context of lambda calculus, which is a mathematical abstraction of computation. In the language of lambda calculus, you're given only a very basic set of tools. Essentially all you have are simple one parameter functions (it doesn't even have integers!). Incredibly, it turns out that that's all you need for a Turing complete language. It's possible to build integers, conditionals, loops, arithmetic operations, and (as you've seen here) data structures out of these simple building blocks. As a next step, and to see this for yourself, it might be fun to take a minute and see how the code presented here could be modified to give you binary trees, or even graphs. After that, you could check out this incredible article on writing the infamous <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">FizzBuzz</a> exercise <a href="http://experthuman.com/programming-with-nothing">in Ruby using only functions</a>.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
<li>Technically, this is really a closure, which is a function with some of its variables already set. In the terminology of the PL world, it's a function bundled with its environment (the set of variables in its outer scope).</li>

<link href="http://blog.usrsb.in/blog/2012/01/28/implementing-a-logic-evaluator-without-if-expressions/"/>
<updated>2012-01-28T10:19:00-07:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.usrsb.in/blog/2012/01/28/implementing-a-logic-evaluator-without-if-expressions</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've slowly been making my way through <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/sites/default/files/linuxsoft_archives/docu/files/ScalaOverview.pdf">An Overview of the Scala Programming Language</a> [PDF], and was struck by this interesting implementation of Booleans:</p>

<p>``` scala
abstract class Bool {</p>

<pre><code>def &amp;&amp; (x: =&gt; Bool): Bool
def || (x: =&gt; Bool): Bool
</code></pre>

<p>}
object False extends Bool {</p>

<pre><code>def &amp;&amp; (x: =&gt; Bool): Bool = this
def || (x: =&gt; Bool): Bool = x
</code></pre>

<p>}
object True extends Bool {</p>

<pre><code>def &amp;&amp; (x: =&gt; Bool): Bool = x
def || (x: =&gt; Bool): Bool = this
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>If you're not a Scala programmer, don't let the syntax trip you up. It's pretty straightforward. <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are singleton objects that inherit from the <code>abstract class Bool</code>. Each object implements the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (and) and <code>||</code> (or) operators. As you'd expect, they each take a <code>Bool</code> as an argument and return a <code>Bool</code>. When you execute:</p>

<p><code>scala
True &amp;&amp; False
</code></p>

<p>It applies <code>True</code>'s <code>&amp;&amp;</code> method to <code>False</code>, and correctly returns <code>x</code>, which is, in this case, <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>What's so interesting about this is the absence of any if-expressions or built-in boolean operators. To illustrate, a less clever, but more obvious implementation would be as follows:</p>

<p>``` scala
def and(x: Boolean, y: Boolean): Boolean = {</p>

<pre><code>if(x)
    if(y)
        true
    else
        false
else
    false
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>So, if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are both <code>true</code>, return <code>true   </code>, otherwise return <code>false</code> (Scala returns the value of the last executed expression). It works, but doesn't win any style points. The nested if-expressions are especially ugly.<sup>1<sup></p>

<p>So, this is a neat way of cutting down on if-expressions. Can it be extended to the other operations? Yes:</p>

<p>``` scala
object True extends Bool {
  def &amp;&amp; (x: => Bool): Bool = x
  def || (x: => Bool): Bool = this
  def unary<em>! : Bool = False
  def xor (x: => Bool): Bool = !x
  def if</em> (x: => Bool): Bool = this
  def iff(x: => Bool): Bool = x
}</p>

<p>object False extends Bool {
  def &amp;&amp; (x: => Bool): Bool = this
  def || (x: => Bool): Bool = x
  def unary<em>! : Bool = True
  def xor (x: => Bool): Bool = x
  def if</em> (x: => Bool): Bool = !this
  def iff(x: => Bool): Bool = !x
}
```</p>

<p>One thing I like about this implementation is the pleasing symmetry between <code>True</code>'s methods and <code>False</code>'s methods. The <code>unary_!</code> (not) method is trivially opposite. <code>True</code> returns <code>False</code> and vice versa, but the symmetry continues throughout <code>xor</code>, <code>if_</code>, and <code>iff</code>. For example, <code>False</code>'s <code>xor</code> returns its parameter, while <code>True</code>'s <code>xor</code> returns the opposite of its parameter. <code>False xor True</code> returns <code>True</code>, whereas <code>True xor True</code> returns <code>False</code>. I'll leave verifying the rest of these rules as an exercise to the reader.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>It's also interesting to compare this to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern">State Pattern</a>, where a state machine is simulated through the use of objects that implement a common interface. Each state is an object, and transitioning between states is as easy as switching between the different objects. Without this pattern, the alternative would be a complex set of if-expressions dictating what you're allowed to do in a certain state, and which states you can switch to given your current state. The State Pattern essentially hides all this behind polymorphism, similar to what's happening in the logic evaluator.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>
<li>You can cut it down to one if-expression if you're on your toes.</li>
<li>Note that <code>if_</code> is backwards. <code>True if_ False</code> is the same as <code>False -&gt; True</code>, because that's closer to the English.</li>
</ol>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Picking Random Items: Take Two (Hacking Python's Generators)]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.usrsb.in/blog/2012/01/14/picking-random-items-take-2/"/>
<updated>2012-01-14T10:29:00-07:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.usrsb.in/blog/2012/01/14/picking-random-items-take-2</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today I had my mind blown by David Beazley's <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/">presentation on the power of Python's generators</a>, and it inspired me to write this highly Pythonic version of <a href="/blog/2012/01/11/picking-random-items-from-a-file/">the random word selector</a>, made almost entirely of generators:</p>

<p>``` python
import heapq
import random</p>

<p>lines       = (line for line in open("/usr/share/dict/words"))
word_pairs  = ((random.random(), word) for word in lines)
rand_pairs  = heapq.nlargest(4, word_pairs)</p>

<p>rand_words  = [word for rand, word in rand_pairs]
print rand_words
```</p>

<p>How does this work? First recall that a generator is an object that returns the next item in a sequence every time its <code>next()</code> method is called. There's an example of this on line 4 where a generator named <code>lines</code> is created, which returns the next line of the file every time <code>lines.next()</code> is called. What's so handy about a generator is that it can be automatically consumed by a <code>for</code> loop. That is, put a generator in a <code>for</code> loop, and the loop will automatically call the generator's <code>next()</code> method on every iteration. There's an example of this on line 5 where another generator is created that uses a <code>for</code> loop to consume the <code>lines</code> generator. This outputs a tuple containing a random number and the line returned by <code>lines.next()</code>. So, the result is that each time <code>word_pairs.next()</code> is called, you get the next line of the file paired with a random value (e.g., <code>(0.12345, 'fire\n')</code>). Finally, we use <code>heapq.nlargest(n, iter)</code> to grab the <code>n</code> largest elements from <code>iter</code>. In this case, it repeatedly calls <code>word_pairs.next()</code> and outputs a list of the 4 words with the highest random values.<sup>1</sup> These are our 4 random words. This is all done in around 3 lines (excluding <code>import</code>s and <code>print</code>ing). Wowza.</p>

<p>As Beazley points out, one advantage of this technique is that it resembles the way simple commands are chained together in the shell to create a pipeline. And, just like in the shell, the pipeline is highly modular, so different filters and stages can be easily inserted at different points. Below, I've added two stages to the pipeline that strip the words of their newline characters, and skip words that aren't exactly 13 characters long:</p>

<p>``` python
import heapq
import random</p>

<p>def isValid(word):</p>

<pre><code>return len(word) == 13
</code></pre>

<p>lines       = (line for line in open("/usr/share/dict/words"))
words       = (line.strip() for line in lines)
valid_words = (word for word in words if isValid(word))
word_pairs  = ((random.random(), word) for word in valid_words)
rand_pairs  = heapq.nlargest(4, word_pairs)</p>

<p>rand_words  = [word for rand, word in rand_pairs]
print rand_words
```</p>

<p>The <code>words</code> generator calls <code>strip()</code> on each <code>line</code> which removes the newline character. The <code>valid_words</code> generator only returns words that pass the <code>isValid</code> test. In this case, <code>isValid</code> returns <code>True</code> only if the word is exactly 13 characters long. The end result is 4 random words that are 13 characters long.</p>

<p>One other advantage is that each generator creates its output only when requested. This translates into minimal memory use. The dictionary file being consumed might be gigabytes in size, but only one word will be loaded into memory at a time (excluding buffering done by the <code>file</code> class, etc). It's definitely a neat way of parsing large files.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this, definitely check out <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/">Beazley's presentation</a>, and venture further down the rabbit hole.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>
<li>You could even use the built-in function <code>max()</code> if you only need one word.<p><a rel="bookmark" href="http://blog.usrsb.in/blog/2012/01/14/picking-random-items-take-2/">&infin; Permalink</a></p></li>
