      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's a quickie for your Saturday afternoon:</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(s, t)    /* copy t to s; pointer version 3 */
char *s, *t;
{
    while(*s++ = *t++)
        ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's a classic one from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_c_programming_language">K&amp;R text</a> (page 101). You can tell how old it is by the style of the function declaration. There's no return type (so it defaults to <code>int</code>, even though nothing is actually returned), and the types of the arguments are declared on a separate line. Although it's far from obvious, what the function does is copy the string <code>t</code> to the string <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>Anyway, as you can see, order of operations is key. Dereferencing precedes assignment, assignment precedes evaluation, and evaluation precedes increment. Here's what happens:</p>

<ol>
<li>The current position of <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> are dereferenced, and the character at that position is fetched.</li>
<li>That character is copied from <code>t</code> to <code>s</code></li>
<li>The character just copied gets evaluated. The loop terminates if it's the null character, '\0'.</li>
<li>The pointers are incremented to the next character in the string.</li>
<li>The loop repeats, copying the consecutive characters, including the null character.</li>
</ol>


<p>It's definitely a cool academic exercise, but it's so obfuscated, that even the order of operations table in the K&amp;R book is of no help. It lists <code>++</code> and <code>*</code> as having the same precedence. To see what's going on here, we need to go to the C99 spec:</p>

<blockquote><p>The result of the postfix <code>++</code> operator is the value of the operand. After the result is obtained, the value of the operand is incremented. (page 75)</p></blockquote>

<p>It's definitely a bit of black magic. Use this code wisely.</p>
