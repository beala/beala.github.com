    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's a math problem that surprised me: Imagine a sphere of diameter <em>d</em> intersected by two parallel planes a distance <em>h</em> apart. What do you think the surface area of the section of the sphere between the planes is? You're first thought might be that there's not enough information. The area will depend upon what part of the sphere the planes intersect. If the planes cut out the middle third of the sphere, that will be a different surface area compared to if the planes cut out the left third or the right third.</p>

<p>That was my first thought, at least, and, as it turns out, it's wrong. <strong>The area only depends on the distance between the planes, and the diameter of the sphere. It doesn't matter where these planes are in relation to the sphere.</strong> As long as they both intersect the sphere, the surface area will equal <em>πdh</em>, where d is the diameter and <em>h</em> is the distance between the planes. Don't believe me? Here's the math to prove it:</p>

<p>First we begin with the formula for the surface area of a function rotated around the x axis from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em>. If you want an explanation of this equation, the section of my textbook that covers this is actually <a href="http://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/ESSENTIAL%20CALCULUS/upfiles/topics/ess_at_06_asr_stu.pdf">posted online [PDF]</a> by the publishers (also note that this is problem 32 from that chapter).</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/1.png" alt="Suface Area Formula" /></p>

<p>Since we are finding the surface area of a sphere, we need the function for a circle, which we will rotate around the x axis, thus producing our sphere. If we can remember back to high school geometry, we'll know that the equation for a sphere is <em>x2+y2=r2</em>. We now solve for <em>y</em>, and plug it in for <em>f(x)</em>, and also find the derivative of <em>f(x)</em> and plug it in for <em>f'(x)</em>:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/2.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We now simplify the integral:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/3.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><em>f(x)</em> is moved into the square root:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/4.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We distribute:</p>

<p>More simplification:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/7.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We now integrate:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/9.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/10.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><em>b-a</em> is simply the distance between the two planes, which we call <em>h</em>:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/11.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>2r is the diameter of the sphere, which we call d:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/12.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>There you have it. The surface area of a sphere between two parallel planes is equal to <em>πdh</em>. It doesn't matter where these planes are in relation to the sphere. All that matters is that both planes intersect the sphere. Cool, huh? No? Ok, fine. Well, I thought it was interesting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's a cool problem I came across when reviewing for one of my calculus exams:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/question.png" alt="The Question" /></p>

<p>You begin with the numbers 0 through 1. Every iteration removes 1/3 from the remaining segments. As stated above, the expression for the total amount removed after m iterations is:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/sum.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>The first iteration removes 1/3. The second removes 1/3 from the remaining two segments. The remaining segments are 1/3 long, and 1/3 of that is 1/9. We do that once for each remaining segment, so 2/9 is removed. And so on.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/sum2.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>What if we iterate an infinite number of times? Then we have a convergent geometric series. Finding the sum is easy:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/sol.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>So, what's the total amount or length of numbers removed? 1. That's the entire length. It seems like we've removed the entire segment. But wait a minute. If we look at the image of the original question above, we see that after every iteration, there are 2<sup>n+1</sup> segments remaining. When n=0, there are 2 segments. When n=1, there are 4 segments, etc. As we remove more and more, 2<sup>n+1</sup> approaches infinity. In other words, the limit does not exist, and the number of segments goes to infinity.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/limit-dne.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><strong>So, even though we've seemingly removed the entire length, there are an infinite number of segments remaining.</strong> That's weird.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now I have you a bit puzzled. This is the point in the post where I'm supposed to resolve the paradox. I have bad news, though: I don't have much for you. I'm definitely not a mathematician (I just play one on the internets), but if I had to speculate, I'd say there are two things going on here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Limits!</li>
<li>We're taking the math too literally.</li>
</ol>


<p>What I mean by that is, (1) as we've learned from limits, an infinite number of really small things (in this case, segments) can add to a finite number. This doesn't quite resolve the paradox though. Usually an infinite number of small things adds to something greater than 0. Here it looks like all the segments add to nothing. There are an infinite number of segments, but we still have nothing left. Hopefully this is where point (2) saves the day.</p>

<p>We're taking the math too literally. When we take this sum to infinity, what we're really saying is that as we get closer and closer to infinity, we're getting closer and closer to removing a length of 1, <em>but we never actually get there.</em> Similarly, when we take the limit, what we're really saying is that as we remove more and more segments, we get closer and closer to having an infinite number of segments left over, <em>but we never actually get there either.</em> <strong>As long as we never actually get to either of these points, we haven't contradicted ourselves.</strong> I think. If you have a deeper insight into this, definitely be sure to post it in the comments!</p>
