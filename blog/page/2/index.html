  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been playing around with a neat command line utility called netcat. It makes it incredibly easy to add networking functionality to your scripts. What it does is allow you to open a port on your machine and listen for incoming connections. Should a connection occur, anything the remote machine sends is dumped to stdout, and anything written to stdin is sent out to the remote machine. As a demo, I decided to write a database engine with it, and I managed to do it in 16 lines.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

PORT=1234
DATA_FILE="/full/path/to/data"

listen () {
    TIMEOUT=10
    echo "$2" | nc -l -p $1 -w $TIMEOUT -q 0 
}

while :; do
    ANSWER_PORT=$((RANDOM % 1000 + 1028))
    QUERY="$(echo $ANSWER_PORT | nc -l -p $PORT -q 2)"
    ANSWER="$(grep "^$QUERY," "$DATA_FILE" | sed "s/ $QUERY, //")"
    listen "$ANSWER_PORT" "$ANSWER" &amp;
done
</code></pre>

<p>The database itself is simply a text file full of key-value pairs. So, a remote machine can send over a key, and the database responds with that key&#8217;s corresponding value. If, for example, the database was full of names (keys) and phone numbers (values), a remote machine could send over someone&#8217;s name, and the database would respond with that person&#8217;s phone number. Not bad for 16 lines.</p>

<p>Before I step through the code, I&#8217;ll explain its overall functionality. When first executed, the script opens up port 1234 and listens. When a remote machine wants to query it, the remote machine connects to port 1234 and sends over its query (a key). The script receives this and, over the same connection, sends back a random number between 1028 and 2028. Suppose the random number is 1050. The database will then open up port 1050, and when the remote machine connect to that port, the database will send its answer over that connection (the value corresponding to the key), and the transaction is finished. Let&#8217;s look at the code now.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>The script starts off with two variables. The first is the port that the script listens on for incoming queries. The second points to the text file containing the key-value pairs. The file would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>alex beal, 555-555-5555
bob, 111-111-1111
joe, 222-222-2222
</code></pre>

<p>Where, &#8220;alex beal&#8221;, &#8220;bob&#8221;, and &#8220;joe&#8221; are the keys, and the values corresponding to those keys are listed after the comma. Let&#8217;s skip over the listen function for now and examine the while loop below it.</p>

<pre><code>while :; do
    ANSWER_PORT=$((RANDOM % 1000 + 1028))
    QUERY="$(echo $ANSWER_PORT | nc -l -p $PORT -q 2)"
    ANSWER="$(grep "^$QUERY," "$DATA_FILE" | sed "s/^$QUERY, //")" 
    listen "$ANSWER_PORT" "$ANSWER" &amp;
done
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is a while loop that continues forever until the script receives an interrupt. The second two lines get a random number between 1028 and 2028 and store it to <code>$ANSWER_PORT</code>. That value is piped into the netcat instance on the third line, which listens for connections (<code>-l</code>) on port 1234 (<code>-p $PORT</code>). Once a connection is established, and the random port number is sent, the remote host has 2 seconds to send over a query (<code>-q 2</code>), which gets stored to <code>$QUERY</code>. This means that after the first two lines have executed, the query is received, and the random answer port is sent.</p>

<p>The next lines search through the database file for the key-value pair. Searching the database is as simple as <code>grep</code>-ing the data file for the line beginning with the key, and stripping that key from the output with sed.</p>

<p>Finally we call the <code>listen</code> function defined above. This is passed the port that the client must connect to to receive the answer (<code>$ANSWER_PORT</code>), and the answer itself (<code>$ANSWER</code>).</p>

<pre><code>listen () {
    TIMEOUT=10
    echo "$2" | nc -l -p $1 -w $TIMEOUT -q 0 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The answer, which is the second argument (<code>$2</code>), is piped into netcat (<code>nc</code>). The flags tell it to listen (<code>-l</code>) on the port passed to it as the first argument (<code>-p $1</code>). The netcat instance will stop listening after <code>$TIMEOUT</code> seconds, and after the answer is sent, it will close immediately (<code>-q 0</code>). As you can see, the listen function is called as a background process, so the loop can continue back to the top, allowing other requests to be handled while the answer is sent to the client in the background.</p>

<h2>The Client&#8217;s Script</h2>

<p>You can query it remotely with this script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
ANSWERPORT=$(echo "$2" | nc $1 1234)
sleep 1s
nc $1 $ANSWERPORT
</code></pre>

<p>The first line both receives the answer port, and sends over the query. The script then sleeps for 1 second, while the database handles the request. Finally, it connects a second time to retrieve its answer. The script is used as follows:</p>

<pre><code>query.sh REMOTE_IP QUERY_STRING
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although this was a fun exercise, the script itself isn&#8217;t very practical. It&#8217;s slow (at least compared to MySQL), and probably insecure, but there might be a use for it on a private network with trusted users. The take away points here are the different netcat constructs that you could apply to your own programs, such as sending and receiving at the same time, and setting up a client-server model. Definitely let me know in the comments if you end up making something cool!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When putting together a backup solution for this web server, I was looking for a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The less new software, the better. Rsync is both powerful and complex, and I wanted to avoid it. Other things being equal, simple solutions are also more reliable.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> I needed to prevent an attacker who gained access to my web server from also gaining access to my backup server. Backing up over an encrypted connection was also a necessity.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning:</strong> I needed my solution to keep several versions of all my files. A solution that only keeps the most recent version of a file is useless, if that version turns out to be corrupted.</li>
<li><strong>Incrementing:</strong> An efficient backup solution should only update the files that have changed. This ruled out simply tar-ing and ssh-ing my entire webroot over to my backup server.</li>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> This solution should automatically run as a cron job.</li>
</ol>


<p>As you can see, some of these goals conflict. Wanting versioned incremental backups, while also ruling out rsync just made my life harder. Automation and security also butt heads. If my web server can access my backup server without a password, how can I prevent an attacker who&#8217;s taken over my web server from trashing my backups? As I&#8217;ll show, I managed to piece this together with only one new software package: rdiff-backup. This took care of versioning and incrementing in a simpler way than rsync would have. The rest was achieved with tools installed on every web server: ssh and cron.</p>

<h2>Backing up with rdiff-backup</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with rdiff-backup. This is dead simple. On Ubuntu, installing is only an apt-get away. This needs to be done on the web server and backup server:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install rdiff-backup
</code></pre>

<p>Backing up to a remote directory over ssh isn&#8217;t much harder:</p>

<pre><code>rdiff-backup /var/www backups@example.com::/var/backups
</code></pre>

<p>That will backup the local directory <code>/var/www</code> to <code>/var/backups</code> on <code>example.com</code> using the ssh user <code>backups</code>. It&#8217;s that simple. rdiff-backup handles the versioning and incrementing automatically. Also, since it&#8217;s done over ssh, everything is encrypted.
Restoring is just as easy:</p>

<pre><code>rdiff-backup -r 3D backups@example.com::/var/backups/www /var/www.old
</code></pre>

<p>That will copy whatever you backed up to <code>/var/backups/www</code> three days prior to <code>/var/www.old</code> on the local machine. Hopefully by now you see why I love this utility. It&#8217;s basically rsync, but stripped down and rebuilt specifically for backups. Best of all, there are no config files or servers to maintain.</p>

<h2>Automation with cron</h2>

<p>So, those are the basics of rdiff-backup. How do we automate this? Here&#8217;s the backup script that I use on this web server:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

RDIFF="/usr/bin/rdiff-backup"
REMOTE="backups@example.com::/home/backups/newest/"
CONF="/etc/backups"

cat $CONF | while read DIR; do
        $RDIFF $DIR $REMOTE$(basename $DIR)
        if [ $? != 0 ]; then
                echo "Exited with errors. Backup process stopped at $DIR"
                exit 1;
        fi
done
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is read the paths I&#8217;ve listed in the text file <code>/etc/backups</code>, and backs those up to <code>/home/backups/newest</code> on the machine <code>example.com</code> with the user <code>backups</code>. So if <code>/etc/backups</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/
/home/alex/
/var/www/
</code></pre>

<p>Then all those directories get backed up to the remote machine. The first time it&#8217;s run, it simply mirrors the directories to the remote machine. Each consecutive execution only copies the changed files over. Versioning is, of course, handled automatically by rdiff-backup.</p>

<p>I wrote the script to be easily customizable. Change <code>$REMOTE</code> to modify which machine, user, and directory the files are backed up to. Change <code>$CONF</code> to modify which file contains all the paths to be backed up. <code>$RDIFF</code> simply points to wherever the rdiff-backup binary is (well, python script, actually). As it&#8217;s currently set, <code>$RDIFF</code> should work on Ubuntu 10.04 machines.</p>

<p>To automate this, simply set it as a cron job on the web server, and run it hourly or daily. Make sure the user running the job has high enough privileges to access the files you want to back up (unless you want to set up some complex permissions, simply running this as root is an unfortunate necessity).</p>

<p>Finally, on the remote machine, you may want some sort of script that manages the backup directory. One idea would be to have the backup directory tar-ed and compressed, then saved somewhere safe. Once that&#8217;s done, the directory could be cleared out, so the next time the backup script runs, a fresh copy of all the files would be copied over. Set this to run once a week and you&#8217;ll have weekly full backups, with nightly (or hourly) incremental backups. The following script will do that for you:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

NEW="/home/backups/newest"
OLD="/home/backups/archive"

# Tar and compress the old files
(
    cd `dirname $NEW`
    tar -zcf "$OLD/`date "+%F-%H%M"`.tar.gz" "`basename "$NEW"`"
)

# Clear out the backup directory
if [ $? == 0 ]; then
    rm -rf "$NEW"
    mkdir "$NEW"
else
    echo "Exited with errors. Nothing was deleted, but the files may not have been rotated."
    exit 1
fi
</code></pre>

<p><code>$NEW</code> is the location of your newest backups. <code>$OLD</code> is where you want the tar-ed and compressed copies stored.</p>

<h2>Security with ssh</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re almost there. Rdiff-backup is installed, and the scripts are automatically backing up and rotating our backup files. The only problem is that every time the script connects to the backup server, it&#8217;s asked for a password (the remote user&#8217;s ssh password). We can&#8217;t be there to type it in, so how do we deal with this? The solution is to create a public/private key pair that the script can log in with. There are lots of places on the web that have detailed instructions on how to do this, but I&#8217;ll run through it quickly.</p>

<p>First we decide which user is running the backup script on our web server. If it&#8217;s root, then we log in as root and run <code>ssh-keygen</code>. When prompted for a password, leave it blank. After this is done, we need to copy the public key located under <code>/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> to the remote machine. If we&#8217;re logging in as backups on the remote machine, then we copy the public key into the <code>/home/backups/.ssh</code> directory (create the <code>.ssh</code> directory if it doesn&#8217;t already exist) and rename the file <code>authorized_keys</code>. Now when root connects over ssh to the backup server, he won&#8217;t be prompted for a password, and neither will the backup script being run as a root cron job. Ahhh the magic of public key cryptography.</p>

<p>The obvious problem here is that if an attacker gets root on the web server, he has access to the backup server. Lucky for us, ssh has a built in way of restricting a remote user to only one command. We do this by prefixing the public key with <code>command="RESTRICTED_COMMAND"</code>. So, for example, we can restrict a remote user to rdiff-backup by modifying the <code>authorized_keys</code> file to look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>command="rdiff-backup --server --restrict-update-only /home/backups/newest/" ssh-rsa AAB3NzaC1 [...]
</code></pre>

<p>That allows a remote user to only execute rdiff-backup in server mode. But notice the second flag <code>--restrict-update-only</code>. That restricts the user to the backup directory, and only allows her to update the backups, and not delete or otherwise trash them. Pretty cool. The worst an attacker could do is fill the backup server&#8217;s hard drive by pushing a huge amount of data to it, but since rdiff-backup is versioned, no old versions of the files will be lost.</p>

<p>Also, there are additional options you can prefix to the public key to lock down the server even more. Check out the <code>ssh-keygen</code> man pages, and look under the <code>-O</code> flag.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, that&#8217;s my custom built backup solution. I realize I glazed over a lot of small details, and this isn&#8217;t really a step by step how-to (e.g., I never explained how to set up a cron job). I leave it as an exercise to the reader to put it all together. To help you, I&#8217;ve included the scripts at the bottom of this post. I also check the comments obsessively, so please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a math problem that surprised me: Imagine a sphere of diameter <em>d</em> intersected by two parallel planes a distance <em>h</em> apart. What do you think the surface area of the section of the sphere between the planes is? You&#8217;re first thought might be that there&#8217;s not enough information. The area will depend upon what part of the sphere the planes intersect. If the planes cut out the middle third of the sphere, that will be a different surface area compared to if the planes cut out the left third or the right third.</p>

<p>That was my first thought, at least, and, as it turns out, it&#8217;s wrong. <strong>The area only depends on the distance between the planes, and the diameter of the sphere. It doesn&#8217;t matter where these planes are in relation to the sphere.</strong> As long as they both intersect the sphere, the surface area will equal <em>πdh</em>, where d is the diameter and <em>h</em> is the distance between the planes. Don&#8217;t believe me? Here&#8217;s the math to prove it:</p>

<p>First we begin with the formula for the surface area of a function rotated around the x axis from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em>. If you want an explanation of this equation, the section of my textbook that covers this is actually <a href="http://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/ESSENTIAL%20CALCULUS/upfiles/topics/ess_at_06_asr_stu.pdf">posted online [PDF]</a> by the publishers (also note that this is problem 32 from that chapter).</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/1.png" alt="Suface Area Formula" /></p>

<p>Since we are finding the surface area of a sphere, we need the function for a circle, which we will rotate around the x axis, thus producing our sphere. If we can remember back to high school geometry, we&#8217;ll know that the equation for a sphere is <em>x2+y2=r2</em>. We now solve for <em>y</em>, and plug it in for <em>f(x)</em>, and also find the derivative of <em>f(x)</em> and plug it in for <em>f&#8217;(x)</em>:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/2.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We now simplify the integral:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/3.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><em>f(x)</em> is moved into the square root:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/4.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We distribute:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/5.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>More simplification:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/6.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/7.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We now integrate:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/8.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/9.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/10.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><em>b-a</em> is simply the distance between the two planes, which we call <em>h</em>:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/11.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>2r is the diameter of the sphere, which we call d:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sa-sphere/12.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>There you have it. The surface area of a sphere between two parallel planes is equal to <em>πdh</em>. It doesn&#8217;t matter where these planes are in relation to the sphere. All that matters is that both planes intersect the sphere. Cool, huh? No? Ok, fine. Well, I thought it was interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a quickie for your Saturday afternoon:</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(s, t)    /* copy t to s; pointer version 3 */
char *s, *t;
{
    while(*s++ = *t++)
        ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s a classic one from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_c_programming_language">K&amp;R text</a> (page 101). You can tell how old it is by the style of the function declaration. There&#8217;s no return type (so it defaults to <code>int</code>, even though nothing is actually returned), and the types of the arguments are declared on a separate line. Although it&#8217;s far from obvious, what the function does is copy the string <code>t</code> to the string <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>Anyway, as you can see, order of operations is key. Dereferencing precedes assignment, assignment precedes evaluation, and evaluation precedes increment. Here&#8217;s what happens:</p>

<ol>
<li>The current position of <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> are dereferenced, and the character at that position is fetched.</li>
<li>That character is copied from <code>t</code> to <code>s</code></li>
<li>The character just copied gets evaluated. The loop terminates if it&#8217;s the null character, &#8216;\0&#8217;.</li>
<li>The pointers are incremented to the next character in the string.</li>
<li>The loop repeats, copying the consecutive characters, including the null character.</li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s definitely a cool academic exercise, but it&#8217;s so obfuscated, that even the order of operations table in the K&amp;R book is of no help. It lists <code>++</code> and <code>*</code> as having the same precedence. To see what&#8217;s going on here, we need to go to the C99 spec:</p>

<blockquote><p>The result of the postfix <code>++</code> operator is the value of the operand. After the result is obtained, the value of the operand is incremented. (page 75)</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s definitely a bit of black magic. Use this code wisely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a cool problem I came across when reviewing for one of my calculus exams:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/question.png" alt="The Question" /></p>

<p>You begin with the numbers 0 through 1. Every iteration removes 1/3 from the remaining segments. As stated above, the expression for the total amount removed after m iterations is:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/sum.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>The first iteration removes 1/3. The second removes 1/3 from the remaining two segments. The remaining segments are 1/3 long, and 1/3 of that is 1/9. We do that once for each remaining segment, so 2/9 is removed. And so on.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/sum2.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>What if we iterate an infinite number of times? Then we have a convergent geometric series. Finding the sum is easy:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/sol.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s the total amount or length of numbers removed? 1. That&#8217;s the entire length. It seems like we&#8217;ve removed the entire segment. But wait a minute. If we look at the image of the original question above, we see that after every iteration, there are 2<sup>n+1</sup> segments remaining. When n=0, there are 2 segments. When n=1, there are 4 segments, etc. As we remove more and more, 2<sup>n+1</sup> approaches infinity. In other words, the limit does not exist, and the number of segments goes to infinity.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/sum-paradox/limit-dne.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><strong>So, even though we&#8217;ve seemingly removed the entire length, there are an infinite number of segments remaining.</strong> That&#8217;s weird.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now I have you a bit puzzled. This is the point in the post where I&#8217;m supposed to resolve the paradox. I have bad news, though: I don&#8217;t have much for you. I&#8217;m definitely not a mathematician (I just play one on the internets), but if I had to speculate, I&#8217;d say there are two things going on here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Limits!</li>
<li>We&#8217;re taking the math too literally.</li>
</ol>


<p>What I mean by that is, (1) as we&#8217;ve learned from limits, an infinite number of really small things (in this case, segments) can add to a finite number. This doesn&#8217;t quite resolve the paradox though. Usually an infinite number of small things adds to something greater than 0. Here it looks like all the segments add to nothing. There are an infinite number of segments, but we still have nothing left. Hopefully this is where point (2) saves the day.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re taking the math too literally. When we take this sum to infinity, what we&#8217;re really saying is that as we get closer and closer to infinity, we&#8217;re getting closer and closer to removing a length of 1, <em>but we never actually get there.</em> Similarly, when we take the limit, what we&#8217;re really saying is that as we remove more and more segments, we get closer and closer to having an infinite number of segments left over, <em>but we never actually get there either.</em> <strong>As long as we never actually get to either of these points, we haven&#8217;t contradicted ourselves.</strong> I think. If you have a deeper insight into this, definitely be sure to post it in the comments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a bit of code from Kernighan&#8217;s and Ritchie&#8217;s seminal text, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628">The C Programming Language</a>. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d actually recommend coding this way (as written in the book, the entire program has only one comment), but it&#8217;s so darn clever and concise, I can&#8217;t help but post it. This snippet is part of a larger program called <code>find</code> that searches text for patterns, but the details aren&#8217;t important. I want to focus on the portion below that parses the arguments passed to the program. Don&#8217;t worry about understanding it just yet. I&#8217;ll step through it below:</p>

<pre><code>char *s;
while (--argc &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (*++argv)[0] == '-')
    for(s = argv[0]+1; *s != '\0'; s++)
        switch(*s) {
            case 'x':
                /* Set appropriate flags for 'x' option */
                break;
            case 'n':
                /* Set appropriate flags for 'n' option */
                break;
            default:
                printf("Illegal option %c\n", *s);
                argc = 0;
                break;
        }
if( argc != 1)
    printf("Usage: find -x -n pattern\n");
else
    /* Main program logic goes here */
</code></pre>

<p>What&#8217;s so cool about this is its flexibility. Those two nested loops can process all of the following (and more):</p>

<pre><code>find -xn hello
find -nx hello
find -x -n hello
find -n -x hello
find hello
find -x hello
...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the usage is <code>find [-x] [-n] PATTERN</code>. The nested loops above process the flags, <code>-x</code> and <code>-n</code>, in any order, and either separated or concatenated. Hopefully you&#8217;re as impressed as I was.
Anyway, let&#8217;s dive into the code and begin by looking at the while statement.</p>

<h2>The while Loop</h2>

<pre><code>while (--argc &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (*++argv)[0] == '-')
</code></pre>

<p>What&#8217;s going on here? First, the while loop decrements <code>argc</code> and checks that it&#8217;s greater than 0 (as dictated by convention, <code>argc</code> holds the number of arguments passed to the program). Whenever a flag is processed, <code>argc</code> is decremented, thus making it a running count of how many flags there are left to process. If it&#8217;s 0, then there&#8217;s nothing left to do. Notice that the decrement always occurs before the &#8216;>&#8217; is evaluated. This would be true even if it were postfix (i.e., <code>argc-- &gt; 0</code>).</p>

<p>If argc checks out, then we move on to <code>(*++argv)[0]=='-'</code>. Yikes. That&#8217;s a doozy. First remember that <code>argv</code> is a pointer to the strings that contain the arguments. So, <code>argv</code> points to the string containing the program name and <code>(argv+1)</code> points to the string containing the first argument. That means that <code>(*argv)[0]</code> is the first character of the program name and <code>(*argv)[1]</code> is the first character of the first argument. Putting that together, <code>(*++argv)[0]</code> increments <code>argv</code>, dereferences it to a string, and then gets the first character of that string. In other words, if <code>argv</code> was originally pointing to the string containing the program&#8217;s name, it&#8217;s now pointing to the string containing the first argument, and then grabbing the first character of that string and comparing it to &#8216;-&#8216;. Why&#8217;s it doing that? Because it wants to make sure it&#8217;s looking at a string containing a flag, and flags begin with the &#8216;-&#8217; character.</p>

<p>Extra Credit: How is <code>*++argv[0] == '-'</code> different than <code>(*++argv)[0] == '-'</code>?</p>

<p>By the end of all of this, <code>argc</code> represents the number of arguments remaining and <code>argv</code> is pointing to the string containing the first argument. Wow.</p>

<p>That was a bit of a slog, but we&#8217;re not done yet. Let&#8217;s look at the for loop.</p>

<h2>The for Loop</h2>

<pre><code>char *s;
for(s = argv[0]+1; *s != '\0'; s++)
</code></pre>

<p>Oh boy. More pointer arithmetic on arrays of arrays. Well, what&#8217;s going on here? Remember that now <code>argv</code> is pointing to the string containing the first argument. Therefore, <code>argv[0]</code> is the pointer to the first character of that string and <code>argv[0]+1</code> is the pointer to the second character of that string. <code>argv[0]+1</code> is then assigned to <code>s</code>. The result is that, if <code>argv</code> was pointing to &#8220;-xn&#8221;, then s is now pointing to the &#8220;x&#8221; in that string.
Lucky for us, the last half is much simpler. <code>*s != '\0'</code> checks to make sure that it hasn&#8217;t reached the end of the string yet, and <code>s++</code> increments the pointer (after the loop has finished its first run, of course). If the first run processed the &#8220;x&#8221; in &#8220;-xn&#8221;, then <code>s</code> is incremented and the &#8220;n&#8221; is processed. The third iterations sees the &#8220;\0&#8221; at the end of the string and exits. So, to bring this all together, the for loop traverses concatenated flags (i.e., it moves the pointer from the &#8220;x&#8221; to the &#8220;n&#8221; in &#8220;-xn&#8221;) and the while loop traverses separated flags (i.e., it moves the pointer from the &#8220;-x&#8221; to the &#8220;-n&#8221; in &#8220;-x -n&#8221;).</p>

<h1>The switch Statement</h1>

<pre><code>switch(*s) {
      case 'x':
        /* Set appropriate flags for 'x' option */
        break;
    case 'n':
         /* Set appropriate flags for 'n' option */
        break;
    default:
        printf("Illegal option %c\n", *s);
        argc = 0;
        break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The switch is simple enough. It tests if <code>*s</code> is equal to one of the flags, and then does the necessary processing for that flag. Most likely it just sets an internal flag, which will be taken into account when the main part of the program runs (this is how it&#8217;s set up in the full program).</p>

<h2>The if Statement</h2>

<pre><code>if( argc != 1)
    printf("Usage: find -x -n pattern\n");
else
    /* Main program logic goes here */
</code></pre>

<p>The last and final part is the if statement. It prints an error/usage message if <code>argc</code> is not equal to 1. Why? Because there should always be one argument left after the flags are processed (the <code>PATTERN</code> argument). The error will also be printed if the program is given an unrecognized flag and the default case in the switch is executed. If there aren&#8217;t any problems, then it executes the else where the main part of the program is contained.</p>

<p>So there you have it. That&#8217;s how Kernigham and Ritchie did it in 1978. Nowadays they just haul in the software weenies with their fancy objects and methods. Lost is the subtle art of manipulating arrays of pointers to strings of characters. Alas. (Just kidding. After all, I&#8217;m probably one of those software weenies.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The matrix equation in the last post can actually be whittled down a bit further to produce another equation that, in some ways, is easier to work with. The result is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/fib.png" alt="fib" /></p>

<p>F<sub>k</sub> is, of course, the k<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number. Now, before I go on, I want to point out that I stumbled upon these two equations and the proofs for these equations in <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/">Gilbert Strang&#8217;s</a> excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Applications-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0030105676/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312385275&amp;sr=1-2">Linear Algebra and Its Applications</a>. All credit goes to him for coming up with this, and I recommend his book for an even more in depth explanation.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the equation, which I found interesting for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>This equation allows you to easily find the kth term using only a pocket calculator. The last equation requires something that can deal with matrices.</li>
<li>This also makes it easier to use in programming applications. There&#8217;s no need to write functions or import libraries to deal with matrices. It&#8217;s also probably faster than writing some sort of recursive function to compute the kth Fibonacci number.</li>
<li>As Strang points out, that equation, amazingly, produces an integer, despite all the fractions and square roots.</li>
<li>We can simplify that equation further for a very good approximation (so good that it&#8217;s not really an approximation).</li>
</ol>


<p>To see how we get that equation from the equation in the last post, let&#8217;s begin with the way Mr. Strang has it written in his book (it&#8217;s the same as mine, but flipped upside down).</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/fibmat.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>Where F<sub>0</sub>=0, F<sub>1</sub>=1, F<sub>2</sub>=1, etc. Let&#8217;s now make some substitutions:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/subs.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We now have:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/matform.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>This hasn&#8217;t changed the content of the equation at all. We&#8217;ve just substituted in new symbols to represent the different terms.</p>

<p>The next step is to diagonalize the matrix A. Remember that diagonalizing A produces A = SΛS<sup>-1</sup> where S contains A&#8217;s eigenvectors and Λ contains A&#8217;s eigenvalues. Substituting A = SΛS<sup>-1</sup> into the previous equation yields:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/diag.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>Notice how everything but the first and last S and S<sup>-1</sup> cancel, giving the final form: SΛ<sup>k</sup>S<sup>-1</sup>u<sub>0</sub>. This is important, because Λ is a diagonal matrix, making Λ<sup>k</sup> very simple:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/lampow.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>λ<sub>1</sub> and λ<sub>2</sub> are, of course, the eigenvalues of A. Let&#8217;s now make one last substitution and put all this diagonalization stuff together. First we define c as</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/csub.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>Then we substitute it into the equation:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/diag2.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>That might need some explaining. The first bit is simply the equation with c substituted in. Following that, the first matrix is S, but written to show that it contains x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>, which are the eigenvectors of A placed vertically in the two columns. The middle matrix is Λ<sup>k</sup> and the last is simply the matrix c. Finally, the matrices are multiplied out, yielding the final c<sub>1</sub>λ<sup>k</sup><sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+c<sub>2</sub>λ<sup>k</sup><sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>The final steps are simply to compute c, and A&#8217;s eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I&#8217;ll spare you the tedious algebra and simply tell you that:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/eigenvals.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/eigenvec.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>This can be computed the standard way, by solving: det(A-λI)=0.</p>

<p>All the variables are then plugged into the equation for u<sub>k</sub>.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/almost-there.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>We want F<sub>k</sub>, so we multiply, factor, and take the bottom row, giving the equation we want:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib2/approx.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s the full equation, but now notice that the second term is always less than 1/2. This mean we can simply drop it, yielding:</p>

<p>In fact, since the second term is always less than 1/2 and the full equation always gives us an integer, we can take this a step further: <strong>Rounding the approximation to the nearest integer will always give you the exact value for F<sub>k</sub>.</strong> Cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a fun little matrix:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib-mat/equation.png" alt="Fib Matrix" /></p>

<p>That generates the a<sub>n</sub> and a<sub>n+1</sub> terms of the Fibonacci sequence.<sup>1</sup> To see why, let&#8217;s look at a recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib-mat/1.png" alt="Fib Def" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib-mat/2.png" alt="Fib Def" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s easy enough to understand. The first and second terms are both 1, and the next term is the sum of the last term plus the current term. To see how this relates to the matrix above, we must turn this into a matrix equation. The trick here is to have a good understanding of matrix multiplication. If you need a refresher, <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-multiplying.html">here&#8217;s a site</a> with a tutorial. Let&#8217;s look at an example of a 2x2 matrix multiplied by a 2x1 (even if you have a good understanding of matrix multiplication, hang tight, this is going somewhere).</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib-mat/3.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s make some substitutions and multiply it out:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib-mat/7.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the effect of multiplying the b matrix by the Fibonacci matrix is that it moves the b<sub>1,2</sub> position to the b<sub>1,1</sub> position, and the b<sub>1,2</sub> gets filled with the sum of b<sub>1,1</sub> and b<sub>1,2</sub>. Let&#8217;s now substitute the b&#8217;s for a<sub>n-1</sub> and a<sub>n</sub>:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.usrsb.in/fib-mat/8.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>Does the resultant matrix look familiar? If you look above, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s the same as our recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence! The top row is equal to the current number in the sequence (a<sub>n</sub>) and the bottom row is equal to the next number in the sequence (a<sub>n-1</sub> + a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>n+1</sub>). Continuing to multiply the resultant matrix by the Fibonacci matrix will cause consecutive entries to be produced. Because matrix multiplication is associative, we can move our multiplication to the exponent, and multiply that result by the first two terms in the sequence (0, 1), leading to our initial matrix:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you&#8217;ve written a script that creates all sorts of temporary files, and launches dozens of processes in the background, and, as is, the script runs indefinitely. The only way to quit is Ctrl + C, but once you fire off this hotkey combo, you&#8217;re left with a mess of background processes and temp files. There are lots of reasons why your script might do this. For example, I&#8217;m currently writing a download manager that sends its wget processes to the background, and creates various temporary status files. It runs indefinitely because it polls a queue file, which contains the URLs of the files it&#8217;s instructed to download. So, given all that, how is it that I get my script to clean up after itself once I deal it the fatal Ctrl + C blow (or more technically, a &#8220;signal interrupt&#8221; or &#8220;SIGINT&#8221; for short)? The trick here is to use the <code>trap</code> command along with some basic process manipulation. Here&#8217;s the syntax:</p>

<pre><code>trap 'command' signal_to_trap
</code></pre>

<p>The above bit of code will cause the <em>command</em> (or string of commands between the quotes) to execute if the script is issued a <em>signal_to_trap</em>. As is implied by the syntax, you can trap more than one type of signal. To catch the Ctrl + C combo, you usually want to trap a SIGINT, which is done as follows:</p>

<pre><code>trap 'echo "Exiting"; exit 0' INT
</code></pre>

<p>That bit of code will cause your script to print the message &#8220;Exiting&#8221; and exit with status 0 once Ctrl + C is pressed (or gets issued a SIGINT some other way). One important caveat is <strong>always remember the exit command.</strong> For example, the following code will cause your program to print &#8220;Exiting&#8221; and then continue, effectively ignoring the SIGINT. What NOT to do if you want your program to actually quit:</p>

<pre><code>trap 'echo "Exiting"' INT
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, that construct isn&#8217;t without its uses. Perhaps you want your script to immediately run some routine if Ctrl + C is entered, but you don&#8217;t want it to quit. The above bit of code would be the way to do it, but that strikes me as a confusing break from convention. Most people expect Ctrl + C to stop the currently running process. A better way to do this would be to use a USR signal. Just substitute <code>INT</code> for <code>USR1</code> or <code>USR2</code>, and send the <code>USR</code> signal to the script using the kill command: <code>kill -USR1 pid</code>. In any case, back to the topic at hand: exiting a script cleanly.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Trapping&#8217; and Cleaning Up After Yourself</h2>

<p>The way I use &#8216;trap&#8217; is something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>exit_routine () {
    # TODO: Clean up stuff.
}
trap 'exit_routine' INT # Intercept SIGINT and call exit_routine
</code></pre>

<p>If it&#8217;s short enough, you can, of course, cram your entire exit routine between the single quotes, but if it&#8217;s nontrivial it&#8217;s best to pull it out into its own function. Also remember that BASH executes a script&#8217;s commands in the order it sees them, so this must be placed somewhere near the beginning of the script to set the <code>trap</code> early on. (Perhaps that&#8217;s obvious, but I&#8217;d be the first to admit that that&#8217;s just the sort of pitfall I&#8217;d waste an hour puzzling over.) Also remember that the function must be declared before the <code>trap</code> statement (or at least before the script receives a SIGINT and tries to call <code>exit_routine</code>).</p>

<h2>Cleaning Up Stuff (Processes)</h2>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve declared the exit routine and set the trap, we need to do some actual housekeeping. I do this by keeping track of all the background processes&#8217; PIDs and temporary files&#8217; filenames in an array. Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>for i in $(seq 3); do
    wget "$URL[$i]" &amp; 
    PIDS[$i]=$!
done
</code></pre>

<p>Three <code>wget</code> instances are launched and sent to the background with the <code>&amp;</code> operator. Their PIDs are accessed with the <code>$!</code> variable and stored to <code>$PIDS</code>. We can now kill off those processes with the following bit of code:</p>

<pre><code>exit_routine () {
    kill ${PIDS[*]}
    echo "Script exiting."
    exit 0
}
trap 'exit_routine' INT
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever Ctrl + C is pressed, the SIGINT is trapped and <code>exit_routine</code> is called. <code>kill</code> is then given all the PIDs, which are accessed using <code>${PIDS[*]}</code>. This kills the wget processes, an exit message is printed, and the script is exited. The neat thing about the <code>${ARRAY[*]}</code> way of accessing all an array&#8217;s elements is that empty elements won&#8217;t be returned. So if I do:</p>

<pre><code>PIDS[5]="5"
PIDS[10]="10"
echo ${PIDS[*]}
</code></pre>

<p>Then only &#8220;5 10&#8221; is printed.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Temp Files</h2>

<p>Erasing temp files is a bit more tricky. The possibility of white space characters in a file&#8217;s name makes <code>rm ${FILES[*]}</code> troublesome. Enclosing the array in double quotes doesn&#8217;t help either. Instead, we need to step through the array as follows:</p>

<pre><code>for i in $(seq 3); do
    rm "${FILES[$i]}"
done
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to ignore the empty elements of <code>$FILES</code> like <code>${PIDS[*]}</code> automatically did for the PIDs, then we can test if an element is empty using an if statement. Alternatively, you can impress your friends with some BASH-fu and take advantage of BASH&#8217;s short circuit functionality:</p>

<pre><code>for i in $(seq 3); do
    [ "${FILES[$i]}" != "" ] &amp;&amp; rm "${FILES[$i]}"
done
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>${FILES[$i]}</code> is empty, the statement short circuits, and does nothing. If it contains something, the <code>rm</code> command is executed.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done. Now you have no excuse for leaving garbage behind (if only BASH had some way of automagically collecting this so called garbage!), and, as always, if you have any tips regarding this, please share your BASH-fu with us in the comments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a handy way to send emails from the command line:</p>

<pre><code>echo 'message' | mail -s 'subject' 'email_address'
</code></pre>

<p>If you know the recipient&#8217;s carrier, you can also use it to send text messages from the command line. For example, if the recipient&#8217;s number is 111-111-1111 and she&#8217;s on Verizon, you can send her a text message using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>echo 'Sent from my terminal!' | 
    mail -s 'Linux is fun' '1111111111@vtext.com'
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, the trick here is knowing the domain name of the carrier&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Gateway">Email-to-SMS Gateway</a>. In the case of Verizon, it&#8217;s @vtext.com. Wikipedia has a handy list of other gateways <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways">here</a>. Another trick is to send yourself an email from the phone, and the phone&#8217;s SMS gateway will be revealed in the &#8216;from&#8217; field.</p>

<p>You can use this to create all sorts of fun shell scripts. For example, here&#8217;s one I wrote recently that tells me whether or not the VPS provider BuyVM has any VPSs in stock:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -

echo 'Is BuyVM in stock?'
while :; do
        wget -O - -q http://doesbuyvmhavestock.com/ | grep -i yes
        if [ $? == 0 ]; then
                echo 'Well, what are you waiting for?' | 
                    mail -s "BuyVM is in stock" "you@example.com"
                echo 'Yes!'
                exit 0
        else
            echo 'No'
            sleep 15m
        fi
done
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple. Every 15 minutes it scrapes the webpage <a href="http://doesbuyvmhavestock.com/">doesbuyvmhavestock.com</a> and sends me an email if it contains the word &#8216;yes&#8217;. Obviously, the success of your own script depends on how well it can parse the webpage. As you can see, my parsing routine (the <code>grep</code> on line 5) is pretty primitive.</p>
